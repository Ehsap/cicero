I'm sure part of the post processing was making sure every flight fit into that nice curve, but damn, airline flight is pretty precise. I used to live on San Juan Island just over the border and the evening flight landing in Victoria (Sidney maybe?) at just after 8pm IIRC was always exactly lined up on the left side of the fuselage over a particular tree. Comparing that to the hobbyists who were mostly on line but otherwise all over the place landing on our local airstrip, it made me laugh to notice. Only ever saw one guy off the actual runway, but he blew threw a fence, across a ditch, and into a stone arch that luckily didn't come down on the plane. Fun stuff.

When I was in high school, a classmate of mine would go out of her way to say thank you in public.  In our language, ""terima kasih"" has five syllables so it's not a hastily said ""thank you"" in comparison. 

The first time I saw her do it (I was a transfer student), it surprised me and the guy behind the counter that was selling us tickets. The guy then had a big grin, that simple thank you made his day. 

It made me realise how easy it is to brighten someone's day, so I started following her example. Over the years I've managed to warm up retail workers, public servants and the like.

It was a tiny little village where we lived and there was one school bus which would pick all the kids up and drive them to  the nearest town where the school was. It was always the same driver and he would always greet us with a cheerful ""good morning/good afternoon"" when he picked us up (it was usually something like 10-20 kids, aged from 7 to 15 on that route). Majority of the kids would always greet him back and say thank you for the ride when dropped off, but there would always be a few odd teenagers who didn't say anything and just gave him a stare when getting on/off. After a while he started bringing sweets with him on Fridays and give them out to the kids who have said good morning / thank you during the week. I think that was his way of trying to teach good manners to the kids and it did work! I remember seeing even the grumpiest teenagers starting to mutter good mornings and thank yous after that, and I think that probably made it worth the effort and money for him!

He hooked his umbrella over the railing as he put the fare in, as he walked down the aisle without his umbrella the burly, in his 50's bus driver calls out, ""Hey fairy, you forgot your wand!"".

Same with the janitors at my school when they come through - I really appreciate the job they do, and I know it's thankless and fairly solitary, but I'm never sure if saying hello and exchanging a few brief pleasantries would brighten their day and make them feel less invisible, or if it would just be annoying unsolicited social interactions that could be distracting and give them one more thing to have to focus on.

* Cars on MacDonald and Alma stopping at the intersections with 7th to let bikes cross the street when cars have the right of way

* Bikers blowing through those last two intersections without first checking to see if traffic is clear

edit: 3 cars fully stopped beyond their respective stop signs, and a 4th stopped at their stop sign before hitting the gas to beat me through the intersection. That last car immediately slammed on their brakes and gave me a smile. Thanks!

Also, one car passed me within 3 ft.

This man should not be making light of this issue, some of us truly suffer from this RAMPANT problem that NO ONE is paying attention to. The other day I couldn't afford to buy a burrito I saw from this truck parked on Burrard, it looked good and was only $8 but I could not afford it because I am stuck paying for my house. It's funny but true and we should not forget that. Would've appreciated it to end on a serious note as to not make light of this issue. Bordering on NDP propaganda. If only the city could bring an NBA team here we could POSSIBLY make something of this town yet. Carry on Asian man, you do you I guess.

i met my long-term boyfriend before tinder was invented. but if i were to post shots of my body like that on pof and okcupid, i would've been sexually harassed so bad.

***edit***: i see how my comment was completely communicated. here is a reply i just wrote to someone who was concerned for me:

i appreciate you taking the time to reach out to me.

i don't believe i have a complex. and i wasn't aware that tinder is 100% strictly for hookups, as i've never used it.

the ""asking for it"" (ie: them posting these pictures is unfortunate, because there are still men out there who believe they have a right to sexually harass if the pictures are there) was just a side comment. and i don't think they're asking for it. nor are they enabling it. men don't have the right to sexually harass. and women have the right to post these pictures if they want; to show off their hard work on their fitness.

my side rant was supposed to be how men shouldn't sexually harass, even though women are posting these body shots. but you can't ignore the fact that some men will still sexually harass, as online kinda enables that kind of activity.

once again, i appreciate your concern.

I tend to glance in the rear-view when faced with a sudden yellow, because it's an input to my decision whether to stop; you could easily be rear-ended in Vancouver if you're an over-eager yellow stopper.

Some moments later, that car behind me turned on its flashers, pulled me over and gave me a ticket for running a yellow.

Fought the ticket, got off.

Idiot pled ""no evidence"".

I had a defense prepared: yellow lights require judgment: you are required to stop if the stop can be made safely.

I have no interest in placing my pipeline anywhere near you.
Your father Justin, has asked me to because you are a lonely bitter
spinster that requires some pipe laying.  He thinks it will help you
get along better with your siblings and may help you actually get married one day and be part of a union.   By refusing his wishes he has found his authority as head of the household threatened.  Take it up with him and leave me the fuck out of it.  I'd rather lay pipe on that hot french girl or the California surfer chick or the nerdy one in Seattle, but I'm stuck with you.

I had just moved to the SF Bay Area (a little island town called Alameda).
I was a student, and ate out far more than I could afford to (I wouldn’t learn that until I had to start paying back on my student loans).

I found a tremendous Italian restaurant on our little strip. The food was amazing. The restaurant was very quiet however. Hardly anyone in there no matter when you went.

The owner was also the chef. He would always come out after my meal to check on me, to see how my meal was, and he’d cap it with a free baclava.

I grew to love baclava.

One day I go in. My meal is fantastic as usual. As I’m eating my dinner I hear really loud yelling. I can’t make out where it’s coming from. It stops and then starts up again soon after.
This repeats a couple of times, but there is no one around to confirm what I’m hearing. The waitress serves me/checks in on me like everything is perfectly normal.

A few minutes later it starts up again. This time louder and more distinct. I look over, and it’s the owner yelling at the poor waitress. It’s not ‘oh, you screwed up type of yelling’ either. It’s the kind where you’re concerned for the persons welfare (is he about to beat her type of yelling).

They are maybe 50 feet from me. I’m watching intently to try and let the owner know I’m paying attention (I should have gotten up and confronted him but regretfully I did not).

It ends and a few minutes later the waitress comes back to wait on me. I ask her if she’s ok, and she starts crying. It turns out she’s new at the restaurant, really needs the job, and he’s been yelling at her like that all day.

The owner came over and brought me my free baclava. He acted like nothing was wrong. I didn’t say a thing. Left the baclava untouched and never returned.
That was 1998, and I’ve never been able to touch baclava again.

For those of you not ruined by my story, please give baclava man all of your love and support. As they say ‘where one baclava dream ends a hundred more begin.’",0.13722943722943723,0.48727272727272736

I will always treasure those few memories I have of watching him running up my street* I'd always be out there waving at him and he'd stop and say hi.

Terry has been a part of my life, my whole life. I've even done the Terry Fox run on the other side of the world! That was a surprise! Moved to New Zealand as a kid and they ran there too! I ran that run beaming with pride and bawling my eyes out.

1851,MFW everyone tells me about 1:56pm,"My iPhone 6S on Telus got the alert, the iPad did not because it was on WiFi and the LTE was turned off. More to the point, the iPhone has ""WiFi Calling"" turned on. 

If you read the Twitter responses from the carriers, or the information provided by the CRTC, only LTE devices were actually meant to receive the alerts, any devices in 3G mode, or set to 3G mode intentionally would not receive it. So any iPad3/iPhone 5 or later would have been capable of recieving the alert. These are all 5 year old or younger devices. 

Samsung Galaxy S devices other than the first one, all support LTE and thus should have all received the messages, however due to wireless carriers not updating firmware on devices, Only the S7 or later actually ""are supported"".

Since there is a lot of common bad advice about turning LTE off for reasons, some people may simply not have recieved the messages because they had turned LTE off. If you actually look at the LTE map for Canada, you'll find that LTE is only available in the major cities, and some of the smaller cities.

https://www.scadacore.com/tools/rf-path/cell-tower-map-canada/

If you want to find out if you're in a non-LTE area, check for 700Mhz or 2600Mhz bands being present. If there is only 850Mhz or 850/1900Mhz bands, then you're in a 3G-only area. The presence of 700Mhz or 2600Mhz bands indicates a LTE-capable area, usually.

You can also verify what is running https://www.frequencycheck.com/countries/canada by checking which band is being used. So if you're in a 850Mhz-only area, but on Telus, Telus runs LTE on 850Mhz. If you're on Bell, Bell does not, Bell runs LTE on 1700/2100Mhz or 2600Mhz. Rogers runs LTE on 1700/2100Mhz, 2600Mhz or 700Mhz. Freedom Mobile (Shaw) is also 1700/2600Mhz, 2600Mhz and 700Mhz for LTE.

UMTS is not LTE. UMTS is the 3.5G networks that may have been marketed as 4G around 2010.

This is the crux of it for me. 

Fact, you get paid less for the same job in BC. 

I know that the pipeline will not improve the economic outlook of the province or me personally. 

Pipelines leak. Profits are private and costs are public. The [history](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/spills-environmental-emergencies/spill-incidents/past-spill-incidents) in this province speaks volumes to that. 

I'm sorry, but I don't want to take on the risk, for no reward. 

I am not against development. I would be all for this pipeline if they made it so the company who puts it up has to pay for every dime of remediation needed. If you have to pick up ever grain of sand on the coast and clean it, so be it. But I'm not naive, that will never happen, so this pipeline will never happen. ",0.055000000000000014,0.4833333333333334

1917,A message from an Albertan,"Interesting that you use the term “sustainable” in your post. Glad that you feel that way. 

Many Albertans that I have met do not share your sensibility around sustainability. And the broad opposition to the pipelines in the BC side of the border is 100% related to that concept.

People want to sustain their coastlines, the beauty of their views of the natural landscape (without giant oil tankers everywhere) and that of the climate.

This is a major disconnect between AB and the rest of Canada. 

Love the sentiment of your post - and feel the same way - but this issue needs to be addressed in a material way - or this silliness will continue long into the future.

We need to balance the economic benefits of accepting higher bitumen spill / leak frequency against the inevitable cost to other industries that depend on clean water, like eco-tourism, forestry and fisheries, and the cost to the public of cleaning up the inevitable spills. We've already seen what the ""world class spill response"" oil companies keep touting looks like in Bella Bella two years ago. It's non - existent. No spill response at all, for days, then a piddling contribution from the government and zero contribution from the shipping company at fault. It was locals with booms in their fishing boats trying and failing to save their main local food source. They get no economic benefit from shipping oil barges through that notoriously dangerous channel. Likewise, a new pipeline won't create as many jobs as will be eliminated from the current system of tanker trains. They wouldn't want it if it didn't lower their labour costs.

2225,Super duper fantasy Skytrain map I made.,"I know you called it a ""super duper fantasy"", but I still have some feedback about being grounded in reality. The truth is with a couple of adjustments you can imagine this becoming a transit system for a region supporting double the population with affordable high-rise housing with densification occurring along the lines and the traditional models (e.g. along the Fraser - people like cheaper river views, even when there are oceans on the other side).

* They fucked up when they built the Canada Line and the platform at VCC doesn't descend deep enough - it basically hits the existing Expo line track.  It's basically impossible to either lift it or bury it below the Expo line to take it to the North Shore. Consider switching this around so that the Expo line is the one that loops back to the North, while Canada line heads East on Hastings
* UBC will hopefully get a skytrain in our lifetime, but there is no way barring an apocalypse they will run a line between where you have Dunbar to Westbrook/Thunderbird/Agronomy - it's a protected forest with no housing. That's okay, Dunbar has space for a terminus/bus loop
* Unless the airport is shockingly central for historical reasons, essentially no city has multiple train lines running to it. It's simply not required, and not efficient. Passengers get on, and then they transfer at a hub. In your case, that hub can be Marine Drive. Marine Line and Arbutus lines could both terminate there instead of heading for the airport.

* There are a couple of neighborhoods that you tried to run a line through whose residents would seriously burn down the city and commit seppuku before allowing it (Southlands, West Van, Quilchena), but in our fantasy let's imagine the revolution came and we've already burned the rich fuckers.",0.001388888888888884,0.43021825396825397

2281,Super duper fantasy Skytrain map I made.,"Love this so much. Bravo! I'd happily pay my annual share to see this plan realized.

Just a couple suggestions:

1. If you've got a subway line going to the North Shore, there's no longer any reason for the HS Bay buses to come into downtown, creating excess traffic on the Lions Gate Bridge and Georgia St. Try riding that thing on a Friday afternoon and you just get stuck on Georgia St for an hour before even getting to Stanley Park. Ugh! Instead, why not have a bus loop at 23rd St, which is a block south of the highway?
2. As Surrey continues to grow, it's gonna become an employment hub, not just a bedroom community. Folks are gonna want an East\-West line connecting Richmond to Surrey. And you really can't ignore Ladner, it's no Surrey but it's also growing pretty quickly and is one of the more affordable suburbs. You could solve both issues with a line from Brighouse to Ladner to Newton Town Centre. I realize it doesn't really make sense to build a line with three stops, so why not just keep going all the way to Abbotsford with stops in Cloverdale, Langley & Aldergrove.

Born and raised here with white people, Indians, Chinese, Japanese, etc.  It's Canada - everybody is an immigrant from somewhere.   There are almost no indigenous people in Vancouver, though I have known a few.  

Everyday, I get so much shit for looking Chinese.  The white people in Vancouver hate these kind of rich Asians.  The kids come over and spend money on big houses and nice cars.  The local white guys here fucking hate that lifestyle.  But they should be pretty used to it.  HK guys came over in the late 80s and up to early 2000s.  Then it was Taiwan, India, Persia and now China.  

I am well traveled, having lived in multiple countries and cities throughout my life.  But the white people here in Vancouver are some of the most racist people I have ever encountered. Their racism is secret - the worst kind.  They talk to other white people and denigrate in private circles.  It only comes out when they blow up.  

I don't really blame them for their feelings, but the people here are ignorant and do not know much outside of Vancouver.  

I hate this kind of Chinese, but what they do is natural.  Their money is new, and cars in Vancouver are cheap.  It's nice in Canada.  China sucks.  It's dirty and shitty.  I get why they want to come here and chill.  Drive nice and cheap cars, on our nice open roadways where everyone abides by the laws.

The same can be said for every single other people coming here.  Vancouver is nice.  The economy would not survive without immigrants, and the money they bring.  Houses, restaurants, retail, cars, luxury goods.  Locals do not buy any of that shit.  ",0.02279870129870129,0.48437662337662346

You end embroiled running into a foreign money laundering kids house and you steal his dad bought Lamborghini. You make offshore connections with the foreign kids cars to gangsters laundering money in casinos. The law is nowhere close to catching you so you expand your empire to dealing drugs and funneling the money into bc housing. The bc liberals are in power so they don't see you as breaking the law and not worth using resources to catch you. So you expand your empire again to realtors going overseas to bring in more foreign money laundering clients that need a place to dump questionable cash.

It’s not even actually automated, they’ve just shifted the work of pressing buttons from the employee to the customer and we as customers don’t even see a dime from those savings in labour cost. 

You are all so blinded by capitalist ideology. Rather than pay your fellow humans a living wage while corporate profits are at an all time high you people can much easier imagine someone inventing completely automated restaurants to eliminate their jobs entirely. So then what has our economy been reduced to? Capitalists who sit back and collect profits while robots do all the labour? You do realize a consumer spending makes up the largest proportion of GDP right? Consumer spending requires income which requires jobs. Not just jobs but jobs that pay a living wage with room for disposable income. So these utopian fantasies about progress through technological innovation are just that, fantasies. Nobody can answer how the economy will operate when the rich have accumulated all the wealth and the circulation of money grinds to a halt.

2740,Read alot of comments like this.,"I don't know how I feel about this post. It's a complicated issue and I don't think blindly raising minimum wage is a good long term solution. Granted Vancouver is a special case with its vastly inflated housing market while not offering the economic opportunities of cities like New York or San Fran. 

High minimum wage can cause competitiveness problems in attracting industry. Manufacturing economies do better in the long run and we have next to none. 

Big companies like McDicks will choose to invest millions now to automate what they can to save long term, removing these jobs entirely.

The whole point of McDs is to be cheap and quick. If they raise prices to pay employees higher I know I wouldn't visit as often. 

Small businesses will have a difficult time surviving with higher minimum wage costs. They can raise prices to compensate. That would make it difficult for them to compete with big name brands and most people go for whatever is cheapest, including myself. 

At the same time someone needs to occupy min wage jobs no matter how educated we are in this country. More than half of the country has university degrees and the effects of that in young people's employment rates are clear. There are only so many positions an industry has openings for. 

If someone working a minimum wage job pulls in $15 then I think people who occupy slightly higher paying positions will likely want their pay reviewed accordingly.

Talking about UBI is also a whole other can of worms. There are so many factors...

2747,Read alot of comments like this.,"Minimum wage is a two edged sword:
- One side ensures that nobody is paid less than X
- The other side creates ""Minimum wage jobs""

There are  ""jobs"" that offer ""minimum wage"" and no preliminary negotiations. It sets the ""standard"" - a very low, low, non-negotiable standard.

All jobs should be directly negotiated for salary starting at $0- volunteering and up to Infinity - profit sharing.

Case in point: Oasis car wash on Kingsway in Burnaby and on Marine in North Van.

I like their wash style and their 60s set up. Their price is moderate @ $25. But their quality is hit and miss. It mostly depends on how many people they have working the shift. Int he recent years they are constantly understaffed, so their output quality suffers greatly - things that all customers have come to expect over the years are not being cleaned properly due to the lack of hands.

They have massive turn over. I've come to expect the spotty service, so I come with my own touch-up rags and cleaners. I feel no shame when I park in-front of their ""Oasis"" - a little fountain outside the storefront - for an additional 10-15 minutes to finish their job in-front of their eyes once my car comes out of the wash.

I asked them once - is it hard to find labour? And they replied that its very hit and miss, people simply don't show up some days, some never show up again, some are too drunk to show up. I asked what do you guys pay - answer was abrupt - ""MINIMUM WAGE"".

Oasis has great customer flow and fair service. They could be negotiating with workers for $15-$22/hr and those workers would show up because its something they value. But showing up to a ""minimum wage job"" is no value at all - there are hundreds of them available and the barrier to entry is literally ""showing up"". So they can be showing up to all sorts of jobs which keeps them entertained and lets them develop all sorts of skills.


Jobs don't have to be necessarily all about income. Somebody living a modest life, with their living arrangement figured out, may want to try out all sorts of things, or do the things they like part time - like washing cars. Jobs allow people to learn new skills, meet new people, socialize, make lasting connections. Salary consideration is only a part of it all. 



So I think ""THEY SHOULD GET A BETTER JOB"" is a fair ""comment"" provided that everyone who's expectation of salary is not met do end up taking the ""Better job"" regularly, so that the jobs that end up ""Un-taken"" will be forced to ""Measure up"". Minimum wage is a barrier to jobs over-all quality.

There should not be any ""minimum wage jobs"" at all, they are all just ""jobs"" = time for money. Everyone has a finite amount of time on this planet, and everyone time while in service of somebody else is ultimately equal to everyone else's time - its simply ""the time you sold to somebody to do what they expect you to do"".",0.10370473022912047,0.49102356992600893

It is ment to be a stepping stone into the work place for teens/young adults with little or no experience who still live at home. As much as I hate to say it, the boomers are right about millennials entitlement in this case. 


Times change, technology advances, and profits must be maintained for share holders that's just the state the world is in right now. Just because Grandpa Joe got a union job out of high school that was able to support a family back in the day, doesn't mean it has to now.


Times change and people need to learn to adapt. The fact that some people feel that they should be able to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world as a grown adult, on a low skill job with a low income makes me sick. You're an adult for christ sakes, grow up, better yourself, and act like one. Nothing in life comes easy, if it did we'd all be living in fantasy land with rainbows and unicorns drinking out of the fountain of youth.


Every time I see people mention this conversation it makes me laugh at how entitled some people are because their art/gender studies/English degrees didn't pan out for them because they chose to follow their passions instead of thinking logically on how to better themselves/society and survive in today's world.


Just my opinion.

Have you noticed how most Mcdonalds allow you to order online now, or you can order using a koisk? They're just supplementing the regular lines now -- but soon they'll start hiring less employees and building more koisks. Then there will be no more front of house staff. Then there won't need to be back of house staff. :(

2960,The quality of mental healthcare in this city,"I have borderline which is not an easy disorder to treat, and up until this year I was never able to even access appropriate treatment because MSP would not cover the private center downtown or any other counseling service which is a major flaw in the mental health system which seems to be heavy on using medications even when medications are not the first line treatment.

I am currently in a 26 week DBT group plus bi weekly counseling at VGH, so we shall see how it goes, so far it seems well put together with knowledgeable staff.

My wife who is bipolar has a much easier time accessing services but medications help her symptoms where medications do next to nothing for me, and I don't even waste time going to psychiatrists anymore, the 10 minute visit and a prescriptions does squat.

What is stupid about the whole thing is it would have likely been more cost effective for MSP to pay for counseling then all the hospitalizations I have had in the last 7 years some of which were 6-8 weeks and still no real treatment or counseling, inpatient was more of just sitting and doing nothing all day.

And once into the Fraser Health region it tends to get worse, especially out in Abby and Chilliwack, we lived out there for a year and my wife was only able to see a psychiatrist once every 3-4 months, now she gets monthly appointments so it is an improvement but would greatly help if counseling was covered by MSP even if its only 15-20 visits a year, many with mental health issues benefit greatly from talking to a counselor and working through problems.

Hidden gutters like that aren't typically sloped water is allowed to pool on an EPDM mebrane like that.  99 percent of homes dont have it sloped and it is not an issue.
Also the collumns at the front he talks about right off the batt are likely adequately bearing on the tube pillaster.  They appear to be to me.  Its a smaller 6x6 post inside that sits on them and a facade built around, terrible looking but likely structuraly fine. This has to be inspected by both an engineer and inspector and would not be missed it would be the first thing checked.
I follow him on instagram although I think he does know what hes talking about in general.  He dramatizes things and makes assumptions he can't make.

You get what you pay for in Vancouver.  The good builders (typically Canadian born) are more expensive than newer imigrants who have little grasp on proper building practices.

Downtown's pretty bad too. The strata at my ex's place didn't do anything about the concrete foundation of one place and once it got bad enough they were told they literally had to tear it out.

Tip :  always make your purchase contract subject to the house passing inspection by YOUR contractor.  If the seller won't agree to that , don't walk away from the deal , RUN.  If  the house fails your inspection , refuse to close and pay any money until it does and tell the seller and real estate agent to sue you .  Don't be afraid to start yelling too.

1st story: I remember being held at knifepoint when someone tried to steal my iPhone while riding the night bus home years ago.

Stupid mistake on my end. I had my iPhone (I think it was the 5) in my hands, listening to music, and then fell asleep while sitting at the back of the bus.

I felt a tug from my hands, woke up, and gripped my iPhone harder. The guy had a box cutter drawn out, telling me he would cut my throat if I didn’t give it him, all whilst pulling on the next bus stop cord. Told him to fuck off so he went to the middle bus, found someone else and attacked her.

Managed to cut her hands deeply and I think he left empty handed. Fucking idiot. The victim had to be transported to a nearby hospital via ambulance. Most people, including myself, stuck around to give the RCMP a report.

2nd Story:
Drank a lot on a Saturday night, got to a night bus that goes home. I had to get off at an upcoming bus stop (which was about halfway towards my destination) or the interior of the bus would’ve gotten a new paint job with a fresh smell. Waited for the next night bus and asked if it went anywhere near my place. It did but I had some walking to do afterwards.

Back about 15 years ago a local from Hope did a lot of work clearing out the trail to the restless. There was a joke for awhile about digging out the tunnel there... He had left shovels and a wheelbarrow.

The tunnel itself was blown up some time after the railway was decommissioned, the idea was to stop people from going across the bridge for liability reasons. Shame, because then we'd have a tunnel and bridge together.

I used to go out and clean up the trail was well so often. Made it over the bridge once (scariest ans stupidest thing I've ever done and it's in worse shape now). There is a small delapitated bridge on the other side and dense forest. Eventually you come to a cement platform where another bridge was taken out.

I had wanted to find a route around from Carolin Mine Road to the other side of the trestle. Steep terrain but if you went high enough a route could be found.

I had wanted to propose it for part of the Trans Canada Trail but without the connection on the south side it's tough. Would love to see the bridge properly protected and preserved.

Do not cross the bridge for any reason. There is an almost 100% chance someone will die there. If /r/vancouver wants to help out, maybe petition the province to preserve it similar to Othello tunnels?",-0.0038888888888888827,0.3452083333333333

3406,A lesson all vancouver drivers need to learn (x/post r/adviceanimals),"Pedestrians often don't **want** you to stop. They are calculating that you proceed while maintaining speed. Often, there is a decent break in the traffic just a few cars behind you that comes to the pedestrian faster than if they have to wait for you to stop.

Things are more efficient if everyone just knows what they are supposed to do.

Someone who stops because there is a pedestrian beside the road is not actually yielding right of way. There is nothing there to yield right of way to. That driver is just stopping for the heck of it. The question of who has right of way only arises if the pedestrian is already in the road.

That said, it is not enabling jaywalking, unless the driver stops at a green light to let the pedestrian cross against a ""Don't Walk""/red hand.

Lesson in B.C. traffic code: if a pedestrian enters a designated crosswalk such that vehicles have enough time to stop, that pedestrian has right of way. (Sec. 179 (1) and (2)).  The term ""jaywalking"" isn't used in our traffic code. Pedestrians are permitted to cross roads other than at designated crosswalks; in those cases vehicles have right of way. (Sec. 180). Pedestrians may walk on roads, only where there is no sidewalk, and must be on a road for soliciting rides or anything else, except to get a ride in an emergency situation. (Sec. 182) Pedestrians may not enter the roadway on where the pedestrian signal says ""Wait"", ""Don't Walk"" or shows a raised hand. (Sec. 132)

A person who stops their car, even if momentarily and without leaving the car, is parking.  In that situation, BCMVA statutes oriented toward parking apply to their behavior: sections 189 and 190.  190 seems to be the obviously applicable one: *""Except when a municipality, a treaty first nation or the minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act permits, a driver must not stop, stand or park a vehicle on a roadway other than on the right side of the roadway and with the right hand wheels parallel to that side, and where there is a curb, within 30 cm of the curb.""*

It is not lawful to just suddenly park, smack in the middle of the lane of traffic. For instance on Kingsway in those hours when when the curb-side lane allows parking, you have to pull over into that lane if you're going to stop, finding a free space for that. You can't just suddenly stop in the middle lane.

When stopping to park, you must indicate that with your turn signal first.",0.06976190476190476,0.3642063492063492

Yesterday, I was cycling through an residential intersection in which, as a vehicle (cyclist), I had the right of way. Pretend I was heading north: There were no stop signs north-south in the intersection, they were east-west. As I'm approaching the intersection, a pedestrian steps off the curb at the northwest corner of the intersection and proceeds to walk eastward into my path. They then told me I was in the wrong for not stopping for them when I cycled around them.

I'm aware that pedestrians don't have to abide by stop signs, but I've been a driver for nearly twenty years and, as a motorist, I've never really stopped for pedestrians in the scenario I've described above. It seems to make the road really unpredictable, especially if there is another car at or near the intersection at any point. Have I been wrong this whole time? 

TLDR: Am I supposed to stop for pedestrians even if I don't have a stop sign?",-0.041230158730158735,0.4923809523809525

Due to the scholarly debate among the identity experts, accent detectives and heritage literalists, I am adding the following Q&As

**Q: How does your coworker know she was Chinese ?** 
A: My coworker was born to a Taiwanese family and speaks fluent Chinese. To Chinese speakers, it's easy to tell the difference between mainlanders and Chinese from other parts of the world. For example, Taiwanese accent tends to elongate pronunciation while mainlander (especially Northerners) tends to emphasize on syllables. 

**Q: If she is an immigrant, wouldn't it make her a Canadian?** 
A: I think that's up to the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada as well as the federal court to decide. 

**Q: Are Chinese (mainlanders) bad drivers?**
A: Never saw any meaningful academic studies on this topic nor are there any established standard to gauge driving skills. DL test is binary; either you pass or you don't. Thus, the empirical evidence is statistically meaningless.  

**Q: Why do you bring up this story?**
A: It's Friday; folks deserve a good smile.

The feds and the province totally ignored this issue until 2016, and only then started to gradually awaken to the major flows of foreign capital pouring into Vancouver real estate. For that matter, the Harper Regime pumped the housing market with ultra cheap money via the CHMC and relaxed mortgage rules for a good decade. It's only since the reign of Trudeau that the feds have taken steps to tighten the housing financial casino.

Put yourself in his shoes. It's 2008, and while housing is expensive, it's not 12.8x median family income. The world economy has just gone bust, and you're worried about people eating never mind affording a house. Housing inventory is up, and prices are falling.

So the firing of this manager (definitely a kind of intolerance) took place without support, then.

Whoever had to do the firing had to first distance themselves from the company, and then act independently.

Perhaps the task was outsourced to a contractor?

Then when that manager tries to come back to work, they will just say, ""we clearly don't support that outsider's decision to fire you, but at the same time, that having happened entirely without our support, we also no longer support you being here.""

5204,Hail to the bus driver,[deleted],0.0,0.0
5205,Hail to the bus driver,"As a Translink bus driver I would like to offer my thanks and respect to drivers that allow the buses to merge into traffic quickly and safely. Imagine this; we have to merge into traffic literally hundreds of times a day and we have a law in place that allows us to do this efficiently yet we still get drivers who won't yield to buses. What's the point? We're just going to pull into the next bus stop at the next block and then you can be on your merry way. It's not like we're trying to be dicks or need to budge in front of you in line. We usually have people standing, not holding on to anything and if we have to suddenly stop we run the risk of having an injury occur to one of our passengers. Then guess who gets in trouble? Not the driver who races in front of the bus only to jam on the brakes because they see a free parking spot. 

Imagine you had to do something for your job hundreds of times a day, like sign a document, but every time you reached for the pen, a customer came along and grabbed it off your desk and said ""I just need this for a minute!"" Eventually you'd get a little frustrated and probably grab the pen back or even call them a name. That's what we go through all day, every day. I usually try and give drivers 'the blink' if I've noticed that they have yielded to me, but if I have to force my way into traffic, despite having the right of way,""No blink for you!""

If every driver realized that the more smooth and efficient transit can run, the more cars we take off the road because people willingly take the bus, the less traffic there will be for EVERYONE. It's really in the drivers best interests to yield to the bus, but people just don't seem to understand. I can almost guarantee that when a car that could easily have yielded doesn't, it's from Washington or Alberta (or some other jurisdiction other than B.C.).  It's seems that we're the only ones who obey the law.

And have your fare ready BEFORE you get on the bus. Nothing more annoying that watch a person start to fumble for their wallet once they get on the bus and then have all the other people waiting  behind them to try and maneuver around them at the front of the bus and reach around them trying to tap in. *end rant*

I wrote this on a post when another dog was lost. I hope it helps! 
...

I am sure they have- but please contact the animal pound in that city and every neighbouring city pounds. The SPCA has a shared database, but not many pounds. Make sure they have the correct microchip number, photo and tattoo (if the dog has a tattoo, if not let each contact know)

Also contact many vets in the area with a picture, microchip and contact info. Some people drop off found animals at vets because some animal pounds only give a handful of days before euthanasia.  

 Please post on craigslist and keep an eye on ""dogs for sale"" It has been known that people sell lost pets. Check every hour and make an account to get email notifications for multiple search parameters.  If the dog does appear, do not contact - immediately give RCMP the ad. Make sure to screen shot immediately, and record all contact info. SPCA sometimes checks craigslist for surrendered/found animals but you can't expect it. Keep in contact and always be appreciative.

I really hope the dog is found, but if not - these agencies may have more success in reunification of its body for cremation.  Its quite sad when noone ever gets closure. 

Again, cover as many bases as possible local parks, schools areas, dog areas it knows (walks, dog parks)  

There are companies who do all of this work. Good luck!!!!",0.22017543859649125,0.6070175438596491

5378,Vancouver to ban businesses offering conversion therapy,"Not that I'm opposed to these things not being around but I'm curious what authority the city of Vancouver is exercising here. Can they deny permits for any business or are there some criteria it needs to meet?

Edit: found the bylaw http://bylaws.vancouver.ca/5156c.PDF I think the first one is brothels of which there are several in Vancouver so clearly this won't actually have any effect on anything. Other entries include horse tripping and use of caustic ointments. The bylaw basically bans prostitution, booting vehicles, a bunch of animal stuff most of which seem unlikely to ever happen in modern Vancouver, and now gay conversion therapy. Seems like this used to exist to make social conservatives happy. After that one sensible parking one got added, then the animal rights bloc took over, and now it's the LGBTQ rights crowd. This whole thing seems like an unenforced/unenforceable waste of time. Except for the boot one, fuck boots.

Not trying to be dismissive of human rights here, but the city of Vancouver already doesn't enforce this bylaw very diligently so it strikes me as an attempt for city council to look like the are doing something while failing on issues like housing supply and drug abuse.",0.05416666666666667,0.3967592592592592

2. Get a cardboard box for each trap, anything large enough for the trap to fit in is fine.
3. Cut toonie-sized holes in the sides of the box near the bottom.
4. Bait the traps with peanut butter and/or gummy candies.
5. Set the traps, gently place them in the boxes being incredibly careful about your fingers (I use chopsticks), and close the box lid. The boxes are just to keep staff from accidentally deploying the traps on their toes.

I think it can give off the wrong idea and cause further conflict between the obvious opposition to such protest. People are assholes sometimes and thats not okay.. I wish people would move beyond what someones colour or gender or etc is.. obviously its WHO THEY ARE that discerns everything about them.",-0.026785714285714284,0.45535714285714285
5709,Resistance - My pic from todays women's march in Vancouver.,"Respect to women but I am starting to wonder whether these marches may not entirely be the revolutionary thing that they're meant to be. 

My unhappy suspicion is that these kinds of events, and the social media and news hype surrounding them, gives the system a safe outlet where people vent the negative energy that comes from legitimate grievances against the system, then go home feeling like they did something.

It's been turned into a ""who can get their picture taken holding the most clever sign"" party. Put it this way, what and whom exactly is the woman in the picture threatening? She looks the part and her sign is clever. But what ""resistance"" can we expect? Another clever rhyming sign? Maybe this is not a threat to the status quo, but rather the new status quo.

5831,B.C. moves ahead with probe into money laundering in real estate,"I am sure this must make a lot of people very uncomfortable.  To be sure, the heydeys of billions of dollars of offshore money flooding the real estate market, rampant speculation, tax evasion, and hidden ownership are coming to an end.

While unsustainable real estate growth was a huge driver in the economy in recent years, that was in part because it impeded growth and drove out other sectors of the economy: every extra dollar that people are forced to pay in rent or mortgage is one less dollar that they have to spend in the local economy to support other businesses/sectors.  

Getting the cost of housing under control, and having it more aligned with local incomes will be massively beneficial for other sectors, as well as the ability to attract businesses and retain talent.  

As others have stated on here, it will be a painful (and necessary and long overdue) correction for some, though.",-0.005158730158730144,0.4834656084656085

It's foreign investment that has been piling into our real estate market. That's the real problem.

Heads are going to roll once the curtain is pulled back exposing the extent of foreign investment in our real estate market.

Here's some reading, but the full extent is completely unknown.

I could find more, but the story here is that China has been investing directly into Canadian real estate market for years and the origin of those funds have come here unquestioned. It really begs the question, ""How do we feel about Chinese government sponsored companies participating in our real estate market?"". I personally, don't have a problem with development companies, but when you have a company who is parking money in Canada for the Chinese government to maintain some sort of monetary peg to extract wealth from Canada. Yeah, I have a problem with that. We really need to wake up to what's going on here.

Their drivers are rude to passengers and deny service to passengers travelling far distances (even though they aren't legally allowed to) because they know their companies won't give a fuck and there will be no repercussions. 

Their booking systems are completely unreliable... even when you call, speak to a real person, and and pre-order a cab days in advance. They just won't show up, and again, there are no consequences or repercussions. 

In any other industry, such poor customer service would sink a company. But not in Vancouver's taxi industry. 

These companies have known ridesharing has been coming for YEARS now and have been given a blessing by both the BC Liberals and BC NDP, who have delayed and delayed. This should have given those companies YEARS to prepare for competition, improve their product and their technology. The BC Liberals even handed them a shitload of cash to build yet another new app. 

Sorry, but enough is enough. Time to open up the market to competition and start thinking of the residents of this region, not just the handful of taxi license owners who benefit immensely from this broken, outdated system. ",-0.12045454545454545,0.5822567783094099

6165,Georgia Straight/Westender doing their 'best of' lists,"Lots of folks her decrying ""hipsters"" for hating Earls, Cactus Club, etc. simply because they are chains.

I don't think that's really all there is to it...

Chains like those restaurants aren't bad because they are objectively shitty, but the do end up diluting the diversity of food and drink in the city.  I live downtown and I can think of 4 Cactus Clubs within walking distance of me.  I think the food and drink culture would be better served with more variety.

Personally, I think of Cactus Club as somewhere to go for a consistent but kind of bland experience. It's not bad, but it's not particularly exciting. It's great if you're with picky eaters, people that aren't as interested in trying new food, people with specific dietary restrictions, people that feel intimidated by menu items they don't recognize. 

If I want a great burger, I'd prefer Camp Upstairs or Pour house. If I want great pasta, there's Ask for Luigi. If I want great seafood, there's Hook. Share plates I'd go to Espana.

I think there's absolutely a place for chain restaurants, and I don't begrudge their existence, but the preponderance in Vancouver isn't moving our food and drink culture forward. And while they are rarely *bad* restaurants, it feels like giving them ""best of Vancouver"" awards is kind of silly in a city where we absolutely do have great restaurants that could be much better served by that kind of publicity.

It's also one of the few places that offers happy hour every day, including weekends. A nice departure from the usual weekdays only policy at most other establishments.

Alberta has suspected oil reserves large enough to exceed the world's total carbon allowance for keeping temps under 2 degrees celsius. We need to accept that the industry cannot carry on indefinitely, and we should be making investments to make that transition less painful.

6513,"Hey r/Vancouver, I don't know if you heard about my friend Martin from r/Canada but he is still looking for a stem cell donor. We are holding an event on Sept 19th for him in Vancouver, come out and support?","Our beloved friend Martin was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia around his 30th birthday.

He is not only a great friend but he is just an all-around great guy. He goes out of his way to help people and his optimism and energy are infectious. He is also active in the community as a coach for youth bowling league.

Martin’s only chance for a cure is a stem cell transplant. His best chance of a stem cell match was his younger brother, who tragically passed away at 18 years old. His family is desperate for a compatible stem cell donor to save Martin.

The Canadian Blood Services has exhausted their world-wide registry search for a compatible donor and he needs others to sign up for the donor registry.

We need as many people as possible, especially those of Filipino descent, to register as stem cell donors to give our friend a fighting chance.

Registration is quick and easy. With a simple cheek swab, you can find out if you are the one. Donating stem cells usually happens the same way you donate blood.

6760,Trinity Western loses fight for Christian law school,"A breakdown -

As posted before (edit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/4qgz84/onca\_agrees\_that\_ontarios\_law\_society\_can\_refuse/d4svpvj/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/4qgz84/onca_agrees_that_ontarios_law_society_can_refuse/d4svpvj/?context=3)), there are TWO decision in play here. They are separate judgments, so don't conflate them.

One (the one getting reported on for the most part) is regarding the Ontario Law Society's decision to not accredit. The other is the BC Law Society's decision to not accredit after holding a referendum on the issue - a delicate and uncomfortable example of ""majority rules on minority rights"". (I voted in that referendum. I believed in the result. I was not comfortable with the process\*\*.)

The law in play is actually an administrative framework: how much deference do we give an administrative body (eg the one that regulates the legal profession)? The standard is a ""reasonableness"" standard. The question is therefore whether it was reasonable for the Ontario Law Society and the BC Law Society to act as they did.

At THAT point the court considers the balancing of rights. Does TWU's right to practice its religion, including members gathering together and agreeing to abide by the rules of the religion, take precedence over a Queer (using this as an umbrella term) person's right to not be discriminated agaisnt at an educational institution.

What it boils down to (in my reading) is that the signing of the covenant is a mandatory practice at TWU, but it isn't a mandatory part of the religion. In other words, a person who doesn't sign the covenant isn't less of a Christian than before. it's a relatively minor thing; a document. It's not ""Christianity"", it's a contract.

Balanced against this is the huge effect signing the document has on a Queer individual who is denied the ability to be who they are, whether walking the halls of the school or at home at night, for all three years of their legal education. The damage and harm this would do to a person is much, much bigger than the worth of a document.

Ergo, the decision to not accredit a University requiring this minor act at this huge cost was reasonable.

\*\* Worth noting that the SCC thinks we were perfectly entitled to behave as we did - an elected board is allowed to take direction from its members, as long as it considers both sides of the issue. Again, this is a test in administrative law and the standard is ""reasonableness"".",0.07028769841269841,0.4133432539682539
6761,Trinity Western loses fight for Christian law school,"Alumni here.

This is the right decision. Having said that, I thrived there and the professors tend to be amazing and not discriminatory (I had a professor in class go on a rant about all the issues with the covenant)

I hope this makes the school stop and look at their covenant. The school actually has a thriving rape culture, because the shame involved in the covenant. I know more than five girls who were raped, who didn’t report it because they believed they would be shamed and not taken seriously. 

The community culture is extremely unhealthy, and I hope this is the wake up call they need, although I’m not optimistic. I think this will further the divide that’s cultivated there, an “us vs them” dichotomy. ",0.09319727891156462,0.5574829931972788

One thing that bothered me all along was the presence of religious schools in the US. Sometimes Canadian judges go a bit off piste and rant and rave about US jurisprudence, extremely glad it didn’t happen here.

As a final point, while the legal market is very busy across the country and associates are in high demand, the ability to find articles (basically the lawyer apprenticeship you need to complete before you’re called) is extremely difficult right now. Most people get articles during law school and the rest get them between 3-12 months after graduation, but I still know people who are struggling to cross that threshold, let alone practice law.

6829,"Can we PLEASE just have other choices? Exclusive: Taxi industry's plan to take over ride-hailing in Vancouver, keep Uber out.","This is ridiculous. I'm part of a video game community that has a 20 million dollar+ competition coming to Vancouver this August (25 million last year). The event has been in Seattle for six years running, but due to renovations on Key Arena, they’re having it at Rogers this year. I’m really excited to have my home city showcased for my community. People are coming in from all over the world and everyone I've talked to is absolutely shocked that we don't have Uber. I don't think people understand how much easier it is to use an app that you can also use in pretty much every major city in the world; with uber it doesn’t matter what language you speak, what currency you’re used to, or your familiarity with a city. 

I’d also like to mention that in the 100s of uber rides I’ve taken in multiple cities, I’ve never had any problems. Meanwhile, when my girlfriend came home for a wedding in Surrey, the first taxi she called said they didn’t service the area. Then the second cab company she called took a while to show up and then charged her probably 3x what an Uber would have. Not to mention that  you are expected to awkwardly tip in cabs. Prices would be so much better for the consumer with more competition and without every driver having to pay off their stupid medallion/rent their taxi from some mogul. I took a 30 minute trip on uber express from Lower Queen Anne Seattle to Bellevue the other day (albeit their cheapest option--you have to walk a couple minutes to meet your driver, then you potentially have the share the car with another rider) and it cost me $8.51 USD. Eight dollars for a thirty minute ride (a 30 minute 16km ride on a Vancouver taxi calculator puts it at $45).

I don’t think people understand how much better Uber is than taxi services because they’ve never used anything but taxis. But I can say with confidence that they know Taxis are awful. I've lived in Vancouver all 25 years of my life, and not once have I heard anything positive about a taxi. I’ve heard a ton of taxi horror stories though. 

Maybe I’m overselling uber/ride sharing because they aren’t in any way perfect. However, I always tell people that Vancouver is my favourite city in the world, and I always have an addendum of ""except there's no Uber."" I’ve never really been politically active, but I’ll be emailing my MLA over this issue for the first time https://www.leg.bc.ca/learn-about-us/members

The cab industry here is garbage.  There needs to be a method to rate your drivers in order to weed out the assholes, pricks, and bad apples from the lot.  Ride sharing provides this.  Ride sharing should never be associated with the cab industry unless the cab industry is willing to adopt a driver rating system where there are consequences to accumulated bad reviews.

The reason you should support Lyft and Uber is because of economic freedom. Your car is barely used compared to what it costs. We could have way better cities and more personal economic activity if we allowed ride-sharing.

The founder of Lyft wants to change cities altogether. And he's right. Taxis aren't part of that. He also brings up great points about the cost of ridership with public transit.

Taxis don't ease transit. They compete with it. Negatively. Lyft compliments transit because it's using a resource we already have: commuters and unused vehicles.

Taxis add extra shit on top of a resource that is already overabundant: cars and people going somewhere.",0.19540816326530613,0.36088435374149663

Uber and Lyft do not, nor are they marketed as transportation companies, even though that is what they do. The gov controls how many taxis are on the streets and do not allow for surge service when it is desperately needed, but that could all be solved by these free market operators who do not need special licensing or training and who knows what kind of safety checks are required on the vehicles?

You can't just regulate one industry and not another, that is not equal footing for a viable business model. In order to operate a cab in any city, an operators license must be purchased from the available supply, and usually used to cost about 500k. That is an investment a person has to make to ha e a career as a cab driver in Vancouver. Now, an unlicensed operation wants to come to town and operate without guidlines, like a special airport license that costs an addittional x amount of dollars, which will collapse the taxi industry and devalue all that investment capital, financially ruining anyone who holds that license.

If they want to buy back those licenses which they regulate and disperse at original cost and allow the cab companies a free ride like Uber and Lyft, I am all for it. Or if they want to force the same constraints upon them as the taxi industry, I am fine with that too, though we'll still be in the same place, but with a bit more choice on the road.

6954,B.C. government will create public registry to reveal who owns real estate,"If this helps the government catch tax cheats, great. I hope there's a hefty penalty for lying and they put some effort into verifying the information that's submitted.

>“Right now in B.C., real estate investors can hide behind numbered companies, offshore and domestic trusts, and corporations,” said Carole James in a statement. “Ending this type of hidden ownership in real estate will help us fight tax evasion, tax fraud and money laundering.”

>In May, the Canada Revenue Agency reported it had identified nearly $600 million in unpaid taxes over the past three years by taking a closer look at Vancouver and Toronto’s real estate markets.

******************

>In 2016, Transparency International Canada released a report
indicating that of the 100 most valuable residential properties in Greater Vancouver, nearly one-third
were owned by shell companies. Furthermore, data leaks such as the Panama Papers and the Paradise
Papers have provided examples of Canada’s reputation as an attractive place to create anonymous
companies and hide wealth.

>While other jurisdictions have sought to apply land transfer tax to transfers of beneficial ownership,
these policies have not necessarily resulted in improved transparency to prevent tax avoidance and
evasion. In order to prevent tax evasion, fraud and money laundering, the provincial government needs
to end hidden ownership, ensuring the ability to look through legal entities, like offshore trusts, and find
out who is behind them.

>We need immediate, comprehensive and forward-looking action and that is why we are tackling hidden
ownership by creating a new, publicly accessible, beneficial ownership registry.

>This registry will be the first-of-its kind in Canada and will provide valuable information about the true
ownership of real estate in B.C. It will hold public records on the individuals behind numbered
companies, offshore and domestic trusts, and corporations. As a result, the registry will help give tax
auditors, law enforcement agencies and federal and provincial regulators the information they need to
conduct their investigations. It will also help those government agencies to crack down on tax frauds
and those engaged in money laundering.

>The beneficial ownership registry complements other initiatives we are undertaking to crack down on
tax fraud and close tax loopholes. For instance, our government is moving to require additional
information about beneficial ownership on the Property Transfer Tax form to support tax audit and
enforcement. We are also working with the federal government and other provinces and territories to
amend corporate legislation so corporations are required to hold accurate information on beneficial
owners in their own records office.

Finally if the government has evidence that taxes have not been paid , why can't the government put a lien on the property and seize it and sell it for the unpaid taxes?

It's a good idea to have a proper record of who owns real estate (and not just have the owner listed as a numbered company, or a lawyer's name.)

But, I am concerned about privacy. The owner of a property should be known to the government, but kept private, unless the property is being made available for sale -- then the owner should be required to reveal their name -- both to protect the buyer (to insure they are buying from the real owner) and the seller (to make sure that someone else isn't running a scam to sell their property).",0.24999999999999997,0.4454861111111112

Beyond the crackheads cleaning their feet in the washroom, the constant yelling from homeless patrons about getting their monies worth at McDonalds; the mall is bleak.
There used to be a restaurant there called Wild Ginger, which I really enjoyed. They eventually stopped paying rent, and were kicked out. There was another Chinese food booth in the food court that used to serve the same food, for DAYS at a time. They too were kicked out.
Other weirdness: The Cashmere store that hasn't seen a customer in 9 years. The Antique stores that are filled with things they actively want you to break (honestly, a lady there said she didn't care). The phone store that was never open. Climbing two escalators to get to the movie theater. I once saw someone crap in the hallway to the washrooms, wipe his butt on the wall, and then walk away. This place was disgusting, and amazing.
The mall finally has some decent anchor stores in it now, and will probably fill up considering the rest estate prices everywhere else. It was very poorly designed though, and unless they pour some real money into the place, that won't change.
(Also, don't eat any penny candies from the 7-11 there; more than once I watched disgusting people shove their hands right in there and put candies in their pockets.

The happiest and unhappiest areas only differ by roughly 1 point on the scale(the score ranges from 7-9, but the range sizes are uneven and misleading) which only goes from 1-10!! This is looking like bad science, plain and simple. Or more likely, bad journalism from a student paper. 

Edit: bad science. The co-author of the paper seems to be grasping at straws by saying even a single point makes a difference. I'm not convinced. And I think from the methodology they have explained, that 90 percent of scores fall between 7.74 and 8.33?(based on the observation that 5 percent  are below and 5 are above).

7220,"Vancouver is one of the unhappiest cities in Canada, study suggests","This is mostly due to housing affordability and income inequality that has markedly worsened in the last 3 years. The housing prices have pushed people farther away from their jobs and social circles. There are also significant financial pressures on the average person. There are increases in property tax, gas prices, car insurance and consumer goods/groceries (due to the low dollar). Combine this with increasing mortgage rates and it starts to paint a very clear picture. Vancouverites face longer commutes, less time for leisure, less money in their pockets and the stress of massive mortgages with increasing rates. 

I know that I for one spend way too much time in traffic and have been increasingly frustrated lately. The Massey tunnel, Alex Fraser bridge, Lions Gate bridge, Iron workers memorial bridge, Patullo bridge and so on are bottlenecks that cause people to spend more time stressed out rather than at home relaxing. Our road and transit infrastructure is decades behind what is needed for the region. Transit is significantly worse as it can take 2-3 times longer than commuting by car. 

It's also tougher to socialize as people move away and you lose your friends base. Add on the fact that it's getting harder to meet new people in society due to everyone spending so much time online, in traffic, overworked or stressed out at home. It's taking longer to establish your career and reach financial stability which results in people getting married in their mid-30's instead of mid-20's. It's no wonder that the birth rate is dropping. 

This is true in most major cities across North America. The bigger the city, the bigger the problems. Vancouver's massive attraction of foreign buyers has accelerated and amplified our issues relative to other cities. The politicians and voters need to step up and address these issues or they will only compound going forward. I have high hopes that the NDP will make progress but so far progress has been rather slow and underwhelming. ",-0.025926573426573427,0.43229603729603727

>The two most important factors that seem to contribute to one’s SWL are the quality of one’s social connections and social comparisons, according to Shiplett.

>Social connections can be described as how close one feels to other people or like they belong to a group, whereas social comparisons are self evaluations of how one measures up to their peers. In the context of students, it’s not just about finding a good study group and getting good grades, it’s also about how well your grades compare to your peers and the class average.  
>  
>Strong social connections are generally correlated with a higher SWL, while strong social comparisons are correlated with a lower SWL.

Other words, people who are unhappy are the ones who aren't out there socializing, but... maybe the ones who spend their days online complaining on forums.

It's downright not ""Canadian"" just how unfriendly the average local is.

The lack of affordability for the average Joe makes Joe stressed all the time.  Stressed people don't tend to enjoy life as much, so when it comes to interacting with one another, patience and fuses are short.

On the opposite side of that coin is all the greedy motherfuckers out there who got in early enough or have unlimited resources and have pushed the housing and rental markets out of the reach of Joe and his family.  Plus you throw in the rental scams (both trying to find legit ads or getting evicted so the landlord can ""move in"" and bump up the rent for the next poor bastard) and the lack of stability will drive you to wits end.
