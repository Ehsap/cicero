3,A man fell on the TTC tracks. These men saved him. They should be recognized. #TorontoTheGood,A couple years ago I was at Queen Station and a man fell onto the tracks right in front of me. Without even thinking I ran to help him and managed to get him up with another person’s help. A train pulled into the station shortly afterwards. I realized how stupid and dangerous that was when I left; it could have ended horribly for everyone involved. I’m so thankful that this thread exists; thanks to all this advice I now know how to deal with this situation safely in the future. I wish the TTC would educate the public about all of this though. ,-0.14142857142857143,0.4627380952380952

313,A friendly reminder from a road-side construction worker.,"/u/cwerd/ now that we have traffic applications like waze, drivers who're taking advantage of technology may be routed around you all together.

One of the biggest problems is that the City of Toronto fails to communicate construction road closures to the public. 

Waze does a great job with lane closures. But full road closures are a huge problem because it believes that the road is wide open, because there's no traffic on it. As a result, it routes drivers towards it.

I hope with better communication, drivers will be able to avoid you and your crew all together.

Working by the side of the road is very dangerous. Drivers are very unpredictable, everyone is racing to a job with no regards for safety and humanity.

Hopefully, you're able to use on-duty police officers. I feel the presence of police, changes attitudes and increases compliance and better behaviour.

My heart just hurts today. It hurts because I cannot begins to comprehend the impact today will have on those directly impacted. The families. The friends. The first responders. The hospital staff. The witnesses. Their lived are going to go through pain I cannot begin to comprehend. 

My heart hurts because what today has instilled in me. Rage. Pure utter rage at the person who did this. I felt more hate for this person today than I can ever imagine having for any person, for any thing alive on the planet. It's a heavy emotional weight to carry to have that much hate for someone I've never met.

Why sacrifice momentum on a hot day if you don't have to? She guessed wrong, the pedestrian instead stopped. She took a risk to save herself some extra pedaling but it didn't work out.

Is anyone else insulted? I ride a bike and drive. In my experience, drivers are no worse and no better than cyclists. The difference is that drivers control a vehicle that weighs 2 tons or more. Cyclists endanger mostly themselves and fall into the same vulnerable road-user category as pedestrians. 
Blaming cyclists’ behaviour for road deaths is wrong, and it’s the kind of thinking that keeps us from taking steps such as lowering speed limits and improving road design to avoid the dozens of traffic deaths we see each year.

Trustees have almost unlimited authority with very little oversight ... no matter what the will actually says ... and the only check on what they do is whether or not their lawyer manages to talk sense into them (if they're working through a lawyer), and whether or not another family member notices what's going on and sues in time to stop it.

Also make sure you have your will in a place where your loved ones can get at it, not having a will can cause no end of trouble, and not having access to it (because you don't know where it is or it's in a vault you have no access to) is almost the same as not having one.

If I were a betting man, I'm guessing this is what's happening.

Deco (Ford family business) is losing money so Doug as administrator of Rob's estate redirected Rob's life insurance money to help keep it afloat. Doug played a game with Rob's shares to sell them to Randy for a nominal fee to increase their influence on the direction the family business without Renata getting in the way as a shareholder.

I can't prove any of that. It is speculation but as someone who has gone through the experience of a failing family business I can tell you that you will do some pretty extreme things financially to keep the wolves at bay.

The following statement makes sense if Doug took the insurance money just after Rob died and makes sense if the company was in or approaching dire straits.

>Doug Ford has “knowingly and deliberately put (Renata and her two children) in a highly stressful and unfair financial position during their period of grief after Rob Ford’s death, and continued to do so for more than two years after Rob Ford’s death,”

Guess is that Doug told Renata that it was a ""loan to save the family business"" to get her to agree and then Doug/Deco couldn't find the cash to pay her back.

1018,"Rob Ford’s widow sues Doug Ford, alleging he has deprived her and her children of millions","I wonder, if I could ask you (whomever is reading this) to answer truthfully and objectively. Does it not seem like there's a gross misrepresentation of anti-Ford sentiments on this forum? I'm not really caught up in the political sphere (too bipartisan for my tastes, I feel it brings out the worst in people) but from reading the comments on this subreddit, all the comments feel biased, emotionally-fueled, and just... unfair in general.

I'm seeing a bunch of derogatory comments thrown around, even at conservative voters like ""conservatards"". I mean isn't this just dividing the people even further?

Honestly it feels like there's a considerable lack of critical thinking and a considerable amount of ""us vs. the big bad conservative crooks"" going on, and that makes it hard for me to side with.

Is Doug really THAT bad? Objectively? Without taking this accusation/lawsuit as fact and taking the plaintiff's word without knowing anything about the case? Please, someone talk to me without gross exaggerations or insults or derogatory comments. Telling me he's the worst person in Toronto isn't going to tell me anything.

Edit: Really, I'm getting downvoted? Come on... an impartial fellow asking for some insight gets downvoted for it? This is the attitude I find so offputting.

Edit 2: Honestly, I find this behaviour so disgusting. The way you guys antagonize me for no justifiable reason, just based on your own heavily unrecognized bias, makes me think that Doug is suffering the same treatment. This is why I don't want to involve myself in any politics, and this is why this will be my first and last attempt. This is why you liberals lose, because you drive everybody else away with your oppressive, bully behaviour. I'm not even voting conservative and you guys berate me. If you berate right-wingers AND berate neutral individuals as well, the only ones you don't bully are your own liberals which results in an echo-chamber and reinforces the behaviour. Why can't you see this? You are literally driving neutral and soft liberals to the right. There's really no defense for your collective attitudes, and don't even try to turn that on me by blaming my ""attitude"" (what, NEUTRAL, UNINFORMED, AND ASKING TO BE EDUCATED WITHOUT BEING BERATED?!?).",-0.04981292517006802,0.5049489795918367

You can't just write your wife out of the will unless there was some prenup that she willingly signed.

Basically what this is about is that she's upset the company is losing money and her share values are decreasing. Take that as you will but everything else in the story is total fluff. As the major stakeholders in the company Doug and Randy can compensate themselves whatever way they like unless she can prove that they're doing it to deliberately ruin the company. To me this makes no sense, maybe they're not the best businessmen but why would they deliberaltely destroy a family business that is over 50 years old. 

I've personally known some of the Ford's through my youth hockey days and I can say they were some of the nicest down to earth people I've met. Specifically I knew Randy and played hockey with Mike and our team was sponsored every year by deco labels. I know they were very involved in helping out the community through their company in any way they could as well. Is that the recipe to a profitable business? Maybe not but that's their decision to make.

Just like Rob it seems that Renata is plagued with similar substance abuse issues and is looking for a big payday. The only people I truly feel bad for in this situation are the kids because they've seen their father humiliate himself through his drug problems, die of cancer, witness their moms struggles and are now estranged from the family because of it. Knowing the Ford's I am sure they are more than willing to pay for the children and support them but they don't want to hand a blank cheque to a woman who is dealing with her own demons and may not be looking for the best interest of her children.


That's just my whole take on the matter, politics aside.

My commute via Car -> Go Train -> Walk was 1:45 each way, every day, when nothing went wrong. This also cost me almost $300/month.

After doing this for about 4 years, we decided to move into a condo downtown, closer to my office, bringing my commute down to a perfectly reasonable 30 minute streetcar ride.

When people talk about the real estate prices in Toronto, this is the key element to the equation. The jobs are in Toronto. Commuting into Toronto sucks. People don't want to piss their life and money away commuting, so they want to move closer to their work.

I wanted to see how Toronto compared with other North American cities in each category, so I made a chart with each metric normalized to 100% being the maximum measurement in that category (i.e., there will be one city that is 100% for any given category).

Toronto and LA both were worst in two categories. Mexico City and Miami were the worst in one category each. Toronto was the worst in travel time and transit cost. Travel time was pretty bad in most other cities too, so Toronto didn't really stand out. But in terms of cost (""Cost of a monthly travel card as a % of monthly income""), Toronto was _by far_ the worst. The second-place city, Miami, was one-third less than Toronto. The other three Canadian cities, Vancouver, Ottawa and Montreal, were all less than half of Toronto's ratio.

The TTC has traditionally received relatively little funding from government at all levels, so it has to make up the difference with fares. At one point I think the TTC had the lowest level of subsidy of any major transit system in North America, and it may well still be the case.",-0.24473684210526317,0.5548245614035088

Alright so my commute consisted of go to Don Mills Station, take a train to Sheppard-Younge then take a train all the way down to Spadina then take another car towards my work.  This commute was very painful especially during rush hour when there were an excessive amount of individuals.   


**Thoughts**

Now let me present my thoughts, the statistics are somewhat not true when it comes to personal experiences. I remember waiting a long time just for my Line 1 train towards Spadina from Sheppard-Younge due to the excessive amount of people. But really what other options did I have? Condos are very expensive down-town now so there's no point in moving now. Like Vhoghul said earlier..

2185,Drake's TIFF motorcade bullying their way through traffic,"> I'm probably in the minority here, but as the camera car was coming up to the light it's completely obvious what's going to happen. So rather than being an ""I have the right of way"" dick about it, just let them in. What's the harm?
So many traffic incidents could be avoided if people just get over their whole ""right of way"" hangup and mellow out.
Sure, they're being entitled dicks, but why escalate it? What are you going to gain from that?
Maybe it's just because I'm older now (51) but I don't get the whole testosterone thing some people get when they are in a car. So they got in front of you when they didn't have ""the right"" to. Big fucking deal.

> Except that's totally not why the camera car drove the way he did. He drove the way he did to make a point. He's not trying to help traffic flow or ease congestion. He's trying to prevent somebody from getting in front of him, because of his ""right of way"".
Look, I'm not saying the security team was in the right. As many others have said, they should have waited for the light and gone through as a unit. No question. But once they made the wrong decision to go, there's nothing to be gained by the camera car forcing himself into the middle of the convoy. He just made the choice to cause a confrontation.


Nice to see someone with common sense around here. And we wonder why there are so many accidents on the road, impatience from both sides, and having to prove a point. This thread not only makes r/toronto look petty, but it's essentially aggressive drivers and drake haters coming out.

> The Internet Piracy Review Agency (IPRA) would consider claims using criteria established by the CRTC, give notice to alleged content thieves, review evidence, and permit a hearing if desired. The CRTC would review recommendations and decide whether an order should be made.

> Further, any decision to issue a blocking order would be made by the CRTC, a quasi-judicial administrative tribunal that already makes orders under the Do Not Call and anti-spam (CASL) regimes, both regimes that Geist staunchly supports, as well as for the broadcast and telecom industries more generally. The CRTC also enforces Canada’s net neutrality laws, all with the same court oversight as the proposed regime.

The pro argument also includes a rejection of “slippery slope” arguments, which [are by definition logical fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope), and which suggest that once you allow one illegal thing to be blocked then anything and everything can/will be blocked. Sookman:

> Geist argues that the proposal is a slippery slope because of “the likelihood that it will quickly expand beyond sites that “blatantly, overwhelmingly or structurally” engage in infringing or enabling or facilitating the infringement of copyright”. This strawman argument can be used against any good law that targets illegal activities. Geist made the same spurious argument against amending Canada’s copyright law to enable rights holders to take down the notorious isoHunt piracy site claiming it could also be used to take down YouTube. This fantastical claim was rejected by Parliament which enacted the law.

> However, the slippery slope – and “domestic laws are adequate to stop foreign sites from making illegal content available to Canadians without site blocking”, “freedom of speech”, “net neutrality”, “site blocking is inconsistent with the current communications law framework”, “privacy”, and “judicial oversight” – canards levelled against the FairPlay proposal did not stop Geist from supporting website blocking of foreign child pornography sites without court or administrative tribunal orders.

Look, oppose the FairPlay proposal if you want, but a fair and informed discussion is generally a good thing, no matter what side you’re on. At least oppose it based on what it is, and not what it isn’t.",0.08101851851851852,0.359537037037037

Our classes were mostly just episodes of Degrassi until one day they brought in a guest speaker, a former crackhead, who talked at length about the dangers of getting STD’s. I was then convinced that basically anything could give me a disease and that, for some reason, my balls would fall off. 

Things really got started in high school though when our sweat-pant wearing, rather old, and definitely not “with it” gym teacher reluctantly corralled a bunch of sniggering boys into a portable, shoved a condom onto a banana, then dismissed us to play catch or something.

They feel more comfortable discussing this topic when they feel it is right, as it has been generally taboo for many cultures and upbringings.

You can upload funds to your presto online, in your underwear. Hell you could do a naked twerking dance at the same time.

2467,How it feels trying to enter a renovated subway station with tokens.,"I pay for a TTC-specific currency. I don't want a metropass because I bike whenever possible, and I don't want yet another card in my wallet.

Yet, multiple times over the past month, at multiple stations, I've run into 'presto only' entrances - sometimes with no obvious warnings until you're already underground.

TTC issues tokens to use on the TTC, and I find it incredibly frustrating that they would continue to sell them while also restricting their use. Because of these changes, I've either had to take a 5 minute detour to another entrance (hopefully guessing the correct one since the signs usually say 'main entrance' instead of specifying), or decide to hail a cab because I just want to get home instead of trying to find the right place to enter.

If you can't use a TTC-specific currency to pay for the TTC, then ban them outright and offer to exchange them for Presto-credit at the payment window.

Unless I'm boarding a streetcar, or one of the few stations I know still operate with some sense of logic, I'm tending to avoid the TTC a lot more.",-0.012301587301587313,0.4474206349206349

Was interviewed as a witness. Released shortly after. Saw two victims down on the North-East corner of Logan and Danforth, with their friends/bystaanders trying to stop the bleeding. This was in the small plaza across from Tim Horton's, directly outside Alexandro's Souvlaki. After giving my statement, I was escorted back westbound, nearer to where I live. The glass storefront of Demetre's (desert shop) was shattered, shot through. That is what's captured in the video snippet spreading around of the shooter - that's him firing into Demetre's. A man on a stretcher was being taken out of the shop as I passed. Heard over an officer's radio that a nine-year-old was unfortunately shot as well. Didn't hear about their condition, only that they were being transported by ambulance to a hospital.  


From what I saw, the first shots were at the Logan/Danforth plaza (mentioned above). The shooter then continued westbound on Danforth, on the north-side sidewalk, firing into restaurants at random. At this point maybe he crossed to the south-side as people with gunshot wounds were being treated all the way just past Bowden St. & Danforth. The last person I saw being treated for wounds was outside of RiverdaleMac (computer shop). So around 3 1/2 blocks of attack. Very surreal scene.",-0.04083481877599525,0.3630718954248366

We are utterly devastated by the incomprehensible news that our son was responsible for the senseless violence and loss of life that took place on the Danforth.

Our son had severe mental health challenges, struggling with psychosis and depression his entire life. The interventions of professionals were unsuccessful. Medications and therapy were unable to treat him. While we did our best to seek help for him throughout his life of struggle and pain, we could never imagine that this would be his devastating and destructive end.

2621,Police investigating reports of shooting at Danforth and Logan Avenues.,"I can't believe they shootin in Toronto...on Danforth.  I remember when my uncle brought me out there (originally from Detroit) & told me they don't shoot & fight everyday, I don't need to carry a weapon & that was a new foreign concept being from Detroit.  Like if someone said ""Canadians don't poop"".

Prayers with you and greektown but if there's one warning I can give for the love of god don't become like us with all the shootings.  You don't want kids to grow up like that, I knew a girl middle school just...cold apathetic to death anything from the block to even 9/11 it was just ""people die everyday"".

It was cool seeing people at worse slap each other then smoke a bowl at kensington market instead of going to a funeral, then seeing that funeral get shot up so they ambushing at the next wake, then having drivebys and shooting up clubs so nobody can go anywhere in an endless cycle...",0.015530303030303014,0.45871212121212124

The racial and political mudslinging that occurs when we speculate regarding identity and motive needs to end. Twitter and reddit have been a gong show since this went down last night. How the conversation is framed generally has relied on motivation or ideation, but increasingly were looking at the group identity and drawing conclusions.

2709,Police investigating reports of shooting at Danforth and Logan Avenues.,"**The Breaking News Consumer’s Handbook**

Some points to keep in mind while you read through the thread. 

[Source](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/)

1. IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH, NEWS OUTLETS WILL GET IT WRONG.

Everyone we talked to made this point. Details on the ground will be sketchy, a shooter may still be active, all the dead may not be accounted for. ""whatever you might hear in the first couple of hours after a major news event, you should probably take it all with a grain of salt,"" says Andy Carvin, senior strategist on NPR's Digital Desk. ""It’s quite possible that what you hear as the news stories the next morning – what they focus on might be quite different than the day before.""

2. DON'T TRUST ANONYMOUS SOURCES. 

Often, news outlets will cite ""sources,"" or a ""law enforcement official."" ""I think you need to be very careful,"" says Ian Fisher, assistant managing editor for digital operations at the New York Times. ""[law enforcement official] could be anything from the FBI to a cop in a car. So you just don’t know and you shouldn’t really trust that.""

3. DON'T TRUST STORIES THAT CITE ANOTHER NEWS OUTLET AS THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION.

""Also be wary of organizations that blindly quote other organizations without solid sourcing,"" says Fisher. ""They aren’t taking a very big chance in doing that. They can always say 'oh, that was them, not us.' So I think that they are a lot less choosy and careful than they would be if their own reporting was attached to it.""

4. THERE'S ALMOST NEVER A SECOND SHOOTER.

In the case of the DC Navy Yard shooting, the Sandy Hook shooting, and many others, initial reports included possible second and third shooters. “There’s pretty much never another one,” says Fisher. “So if you hear that, you can almost always discount.""

5. PAY ATTENTION TO THE LANGUAGE THE MEDIA USES.

Whether you realize it or not, the language the media uses tells you how reliable it is. Here's a helpful glossary:

""We are receiving reports"" - sources are claiming something has happened, but it has not been confirmed.
""We are seeking confirmation"" - the news outlet is confident, but still can't confirm.
""We can confirm"" - information has come from multiple sources, and the news outlet feels confident that it can claim something as an actual fact.
""We have learned"" - how a news outlet declares it has a scoop. As Andy Carvin says ""on the one hand, it could mean that they’re the first ones to confirm something. Or they’re going out on a limb and reporting something that no one else has felt comfortable reporting yet.""

6. LOOK FOR NEWS OUTLETS CLOSE TO THE INCIDENT.

""What you want to do is ask yourself who is close enough to this situation,"" says Craig Silverman of Poynter's Regret the Error column. ""In an incident of terrorism or shooting or even when it’s sort of weather focused in a specific area, that’s always your preferred source. Have they actually seen it with their own eyes? Are they actually there, and do they know the area? Really, really, important."" 

7. COMPARE MULTIPLE SOURCES.

""If a news organization says 'we can confirm that such and such has happened,' pay attention to what the other networks are saying."" says Andy Carvin. ""Because ideally you can triangulate that information and get to some nugget of truth. But the fewer examples you have of entities claiming that something has happened, the more wary you should be about it.""

8. BIG NEWS BRINGS OUT THE FAKERS. AND PHOTOSHOPPERS.

""There are lots of hoaxsters who know that in this moment people are just grabbing onto any images they can find,"" says Craig Silverman. ""So they might Photoshop something and send it out. Or images that were taken previously find their way to be presented as if they're new. If it’s somebody who’s sharing a photo on twitter, it’s very possible that that photo isn’t one they actually took themselves. You also need to kind of triangulate and see, well, 'has anyone else shared that, and are they giving me a link that I can go to, to actually learn more about this?'""

9. BEWARE REFLEXIVE RETWEETING. SOME OF THIS IS ON YOU.

Thanks to Twitter and Facebook, you are a repeater and reporter of information, both good and bad. It is up to you to apply scrutiny to the information you encounter to avoid passing amplifying the same bad information you hope to filter out.",0.06231842231842232,0.4649723424723426

The problem isn't with guns. Legal lawful gun owners obey and abide by the laws. The problem is that fools and hooligans who do not obey to laws conduct acts of violence with weapons of destruction, whether it be a gun, van, bomb, or other weapons. Our society is becoming too soft. We need to strengthen up, if someone you know is talking about some questionable shit, tell someone. If you see people in your area doing some questionable shit, tell someone. Even if you're not sure, the cops would rather a false precautionary call than to have another act of mass violence.

2821,Police investigating reports of shooting at Danforth and Logan Avenues.,"I live not a five minuet walk west of where this happened. I walk around that area almost daily (usually when meeting friends for drinks). Luckily I was staying at my GF's place in the west end of the city last night. 

On a side note. Back in May my girlfriend's parents were visiting us for a Jay's game and a concert. After the concert we all went to the Pearl Diver for a late night drink and a bite to eat. Not 10 min after we sat down the front window shattered. I remember a blood curdling scream and someone yelling ""EVERYONE GET DOWN!"" 

Many things ran through my mind as we all dropped to the floor; was it a bomb?; was there a shooter?; is this a terrorist attack like the one in Paris?; am I about to die? 

We cowered on the floor for what felt like an eternity (likely only 5 seconds) awaiting our fate. After nothing else happened we slowly stood up and began to investigate. 

As it turned out, someone from the outside had thrown a broom handle at the window. A man sitting near the window received cuts on his face. 

The perpetrator was chased by some of the restaurant's employees into the park across the street and tackled. He was later arrested. 

Paramedics arrived and treated the injured man. 

As our bodies metabolized the adrenaline and we returned to our food & drinks, another emotional state began to arise in us. Embarrassment. 

""How silly of us to have leaped to such dreadful conclusions. Toronto is the safest city in the world... right?""

Side note:
I legitimately loathe it when people type/say legit. If it's legitimate, say so! Shortening legitimate makes the word a slang and delegitimizes it! And don't tell me about shorter words being quicker to type; we live in the age of autocorrect, auto fill, and 'suggested words' for quick type. Can we all agree at this point to just let 'legit' go? Legitimate isn't that hard to say or type. Annnnd I'm officially an old man :P

You can say that Toronto should regulate 4 storey max in some areas, but then literally nothing would be built since you couldn't make a profit.

Really the only way I see it is by the city offering *huge* rebates to developers for building very specific type buildings.... and good fucking luck getting *that* done.

One with a tub/shower and sink, and a the other with the toilet and sink, so way more useable by multiple people.  It had a shared yard that kids in the building could all play in, and the kitchens in the units all faced the yard.  You got the density, great layout, no lawn or maintenance, yet you could do dishes while the kids are in the secure yard and see them and call them in from the window.

3389,Subway: Toronto vs. New York City,"The median ridership on a weekday in New York is around 7,466 passengers. I got that using the data here.

http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_sub.htm

They are running almost a hundred stations that get less than 4000 people a day.

I wasn't able to get 2017 data from the City of Toronto since they've decided to ""upgrade"" (aka break and then not fix) the data website. 

However, eyeballing the 2016 figures (which I can only find through a PDF https://www.ttc.ca/PDF/Transit_Planning/Subway%20ridership%202016.pdf ) it looks like the median ridership for TTC subway stations (excluding the SRT since it doesn't use subway cars) is probably closer to 15,000 easily. 

That isn't to say we couldn't use more stations in Toronto, but if you are looking at a city to aspire to, New York is not it. They have literally hundreds of stations that very few people use because they have to go insane lengths to use them. They are going to have to make some hard decisions about a lot of these stations because maintenance is going to become a huge issue for them.",0.03524793388429754,0.5914325068870524

While it is a good argument that New York has a way higher population and density, it doesn't take away from the fact Toronto's transit system is a joke. Compared to almost any major city in the world, Toronto has to have one of the smallest subway system. Even cities with lower population and densities than Toronto has a better subway system. Using density as an argument to why our subway system is lacking is not a good argument. Just take a look at Munich.

After that period of time has passed and the property has remained unclaimed (proof of ownership required), the police will contact you (or your lawyer) and the property becomes yours, lawfully. For various good reasons, you may want to do this anonymously. I would assume, but can't actually confirm, that you can retain a lawyer to do this on your behalf. The identity of a lawyer's client is privileged and confidential. It cannot be compelled from a lawyer by the police or others (except in exceptional circumstances that vitiate the privilege, and with a court order, such as using your lawyer to further a criminal conspiracy). This is not legal advice. Just information. Talk to a lawyer. Most will not charge for an initial meeting to discuss retainer. ",0.11979166666666666,0.434375

The thugs are probably nearby watching it. I’m thinking go to a nearby dollar store, buy a ski mask, then stand a couple of blocks away and sprint at max speed towards the bag, grab it, and keep running for as long as you can. Maybe zig zag through some buildings. You will be in and out within seconds and they will never know it is you. All they saw was some random guy who ran in, swiped it, and ran off.

- Unspecified tip on a potential terrorist threat

Reasoning:

- They want public to be alert, but not of whom/what/where specifically

- The increases of presence are at dense, tourist-y locations: Wonderland, Rogers Centre, CN Tower, Eaton (iirc Eaton). Those are dense places to try to do harm.

- They are vague with saying exactly how much outside help that they are getting. This is useful in shows of force to deter an action. 

- It sounds like they are getting provincial and federal support in addition to the GTA forces.

- They wanted the media there to make sure that ""we"" know how much the police are doing to keep us safe. Today in particular.

- Purposely avoiding alleviating concerns about an ongoing threat. It very much seems like the threat is ongoing.

- According to a spokesperson for Metrolinx, the transit system has been placed on a ""heightened vigilance level"". They specifically cite concerns about Union Station downtown.

There is a photo halfway down captioned 

“Toronto Police Service detector dog, Devi, around the Rogers Centre on Thursday.”

Don’t think a bomb sniffing dog would be needed for vehicle ramming threat ? 

Just my observation though. Possibly all the police eyes are for placed bombs like the Boston Marathon bombing? This could explain the YRP drone at wonderland as well?

TTC ordered a shit load and almost all of them are sitting in the yards, not being used because they're not syncing correctly to the system. The ttc sunk a shit ton into busses they can't use. When pressured to use them, the likelihood of tracking them goes out the window and any busses get fucked and become temporarily untraceable.

The Office of the Integrity Commissioner does not have the authority to accept requests from members of the public to review or investigate the activities of an elected official.

 

While I cannot offer specific information about the issue you have raised, I can tell you that this Office is working with all Members of Provincial Parliament to ensure they are compliant with their obligations under the Members’ Integrity Act, 1994, which is the legislation that has replaced the Members’ Conflict of Interest Act you referenced in your email. 

 

I would also like to note that there is a difference between the appointment of a trustee as opposed to the appointment of a director. When a trust is put in place, the Act requires that the Integrity Commissioner must approve both the trustee as well as the provisions of the trust. However, the Commissioner has no role in the selection or appointment of corporate directors.

I understand that it improved their quality of life and they could ""do as they please... following their dream""  instead of working for their dream.... but FUCK.....

I'm a single mom to a special needs kid.  He has dr's appts and school meetings I need to attend.  I have 2 parents and an uncle who were all so sick 2 years ago that I had a mental pool going as to which funeral I'd be going to first.  I'm looking for work all in this time.  I have had interviews.  Some were sooo,  so so promising.  I'm not one to lie tho.  So when they ask when I can start, if I have anything coming up I might have to deal with or attend to, what will I do if I'm at work and the school calls...again... about my son.  I have no answer.  I have no money to have a sitter willing to help with my son.  I have no money to help my parents with cab money if I'm working and they need a lift to the hospital/dr/specialist or home.  I can't even smile properly at my interviewer because I need a dentist and can't afford it.

Cancelling the basic income pilot for single people with no responsibilities and use it to ""follow their dreams"" is fine with me.  I wish they would re work it tho to help people like me.  People who would use the money for their kids.  For their family.  To better themselves/situations to get jobs/better jobs/opportunities and live better.  I get just enough for rent and to feed my son and even that will be gone come November.  Still figuring out how to tell my son Santa will have to visit us in the car this year. 

The basic income would have helped me get back on my feet and live, as it was intended.... not ""follow my dreams"" like some AMA's have talked about.  

I hope the mini trump wannabe will readdress the way the basic income thing is done.  It could actually help the actual poor and needy in the province.

I will say that I am wary of results from pilot programs like this.  The problem is that since they know it's only temporary, the participants may not behave in the same way that the general population would if the program became permanent.  However, with a revolution in automation and the effects on jobs already underway, we are going to need some kind of similar program in the future, and so we are going to have to figure out how to handle this problem pretty soon.",0.05,0.4903846153846155

And considering the location, it was pretty obvious why apartments were so cheap in that area. So naturally my sister starts getting sketched out and says ""Maybe we should take a side street?""

She started heading toward an allyway and I promptly stopped her and said ""I wouldn't if I were you. There are raccoons down there.""

""Yeah, but there are crack heads out here"" she replied. ""Raccoons can't be that bad.""

""Not these raccoons,"" I said. ""They hiss at each other and try to throw each other out of trees."" 

As my sister and I were discussing the dangers of raccoons, and how crackheads are pretty much harmless, a passing crack head on a bike rolled past us and said ""You kids be careful down there. There's raccoons down there."" 

It was so coincidental we just burst out laughing and decided to stick to the main streets. ",1.3877787807814457e-17,0.5229166666666667

If you’re so worried about raccoons when you walk around at night, carry a little bit of food with you, like dog food kibble or something. You drop it down, they no longer give two fucks about you and will get at the food as soon as they have a clear path.

Politicians care zero about people who don’t actually make a choice. Politicians cater to a broad, general voter base.

The shit that we all complain about?  It doesn't all get decided today.  Party platforms (generally, I'm not talking about Doug) are developed over time.  There are caucus meetings and insider back room strategy discussions and all sorts of shit that happens all the time.  And those decisions are shaped in part by what happens today.  Even if your vote has little to no chance of changing the winner, it does count towards how close or far the riding is seen from being a possible pick-up next time around.  Which will be part of how the parties position themselves next election.

You need to vote so that parties know that your vote is available.  Even if it is unlikely to count this time around - it sends a message about your preferences which will come into play when new policies and platforms are being developed.  A cynical way of looking at it is that the political parties and the government that forms cannot pander to you unless they know you're there.  So go vote.

Even in the case of Doug ""Who needs a platform - I'm just winging it"" Ford, this is a special case.  Parties generally don't dump their leaders with only a few months to go before the election.",-0.05566635745207173,0.5155225726654298

5316,What happens when Tesla installs 20 Super Chargers at Vaughan Mills,"You ever see those towing scam videos where they wait for people to park somewhere and then the dudes come out of nowhere, hook up the car and are gone?

They need that, except a tow truck parked right there. 

Tesla should just pay a tow truck operator to sit there as a deterrent. The moment someone parks there, the truck goes up and starts hooking up the car with the person still in it.

""Oh, do you want to move? We can let you go. I haven't called it in yet"" or something. 

There's a thing I call ""casino lights"" - it's a way to describe ""retail hypnosis"" in people. The idea behind a casino is to dazzle the customer so that they lose track of what they're doing and spend a bunch of money.

The same thing happens in stores. Which is why you get that seemingly inconsiderate person who parks their cart diagonally on the left side of the aisle, then looks at things on the right side of the aisle, blocking a full 6' of aisle. And you can stand there in their periphery and they don't see you. 

Because retail shopping has that kind of hold on the mind. Don't believe me? Ever see a kid flip shit at Toys R Us? It's anti-Disneyland. It's the least happiest place on earth. I worked there. Kids flip the fuck out because all of the products and colours and shit overload their little brains.

People never outgrow that. When they shop, they are mesmerised. And it's the same thing when they're about to go shopping. Their brain kicks into ""retail mode"" just like ""casino lights"". Either way, they're hypnotic. Then you get other factors like the fact they're starting to become oblivious about money or really stressed about it and they can't see anything in front of them. 

It's why people park across several spaces. Fight over parking spaces. Hit your car door with the edge of their door. It's not just being inconsiderate, it's that they are literally out of their god damn minds. It affects their ability to think clearly and reason. 

You see that all the time in psychology. It can be ""temporary insanity"" or a ""break"", but it really is what shopping does to people. Consumerism makes you a dullard.",0.010996240601503761,0.41209273182957395

You could go to any major shopping area and find everyone has left the shopping carts out of their holding areas, jeopardizing both safety and the adjacent cars. As you walk into Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, you will find the shopping cart holding area completely empty and every shopping cart right where people offloaded their supplies into the vehicles and just drive the f*** off. 
Toronto is descending into a city of ""it's someone else's problem""

It's become so bad that there are now multiple people shepherding karts in and out of their holding areas.

Often as you pull into a shopping mall parking lot you won't even be able to find a parking space as you're likely to ding your car bumper from the cards strewn all over the lot.

This is just pedestrian, s***** f****** Behavior.

Being considerate is a finite resource, and its reserves are rapidly depleting in Toronto.

That weekend I was visiting a friend in my hometown of Niagara Falls and felt like it would be the perfect place to take it for my first ride. I show up and the roads are closed. Police were doing traffic control and there were hundreds of cyclists up and down the Parkway. Well, I paced up and down the Parkway for a little while until I got up enough nerve to jump on my bike and get out there. I couldn't figure out my gears and was having a difficult time with my pedals - I hadn't rode a bike in years. I bothered a few of you cyclists who were on their last stretch of the race who were so helpful and told me I should join in next year! I was happy to have a funny story for my first ride. 

Congratulations on your ride and thank you :) ",0.12508680555555554,0.4902777777777777

5506,"80% of Toronto residents support building protected bike lanes, poll finds"," I cycled in Toronto for over a decade, and, for the sake of the argument, here are my arguments against protected bike lanes, as implemented on Sherbourne:

 1. Protected bike lanes are not cleaned in winter
 2. It's hard to overtake a slow cyclist on a protected lane
 3. The most dangerous part is crossing the intersection - and this is where a protected bike lane doesn't help. If anything, it's much harder to go around a half-turned guy who blocked off a bike lane.
 4. Bus stops. On Sherbourne, essentially bus stop is a part of a bike lane, which means that you stop for buses, and which also means that inattentive pedestrians can walk in your path (and, similarly, inattentive cyclists can be oblivious to people leaving the bus).

IMO, Toronto has a whole class of summer cyclists who maybe cycle a few dozen times in summer and park their bikes in winter. These guys often don't think of themselves as a part of general traffic, and mostly heavily in favour of separated and protected bike lanes. Therefore, it should be taken into account that most bike lane traffic will be seasonal, and that maybe it is a good idea to make the barriers removable so that the snow is cleaned - or, at the very least, make more consideration about killing lanes to narrow the roads, because in the end TTC buses use the same traffic as everyone else.",0.009901960784313723,0.4227450980392156

• **Dashcam Driver** safely overtook **Hatchback** in order to take the middle lane *way* before arriving at the intersection.

• **Baddy** was driving far too wrecklessly behind **Leader** in order to safely break as they slowed towards the intersection. (**Dashcam** was driving at the same speed *without* a vehicle in front of them.. **Leader** was applying breaks a full 5 seconds before **Baddy** accelerated past them)

• At no point in this *entire* video was the approaching intersection available for incoming traffic to pass through. (Red light is seen from previous intersection.. intersecting traffic is crossing through at least 10 seconds prior to crosswalk infraction)

And don't even get me *started* about how **Baddy** just blindly reversed back through the crosswalk and narrowly missed smoking a pedestrian who was crossing on their green light...

If you honestly think **Dashcam Driver** has any part in the mayhem that just ensued, please surrender your drivers license immediately. *Cheers!*

When my dad first came to canada back in the 90s, he was a struggling immigrant who needed housing. He came to Marilyn Churry to have her sign the form he needed to be approved for government housing. She flat out refused him and told him she doesn't do that. He then went to another MPP - Dennis Mills at the time, who was more than happy to sign the paper. He shook my dad's hand and told him how happy he was to have my dad in Canada. My dad was in tears at the time. And furious that the person he voted for, didn't give a fuck about him and this guy did.

I don't really get politics and I usually just vote liberal. But I see a lot of NDP lovers lately and I don't get why. NDP does not give a fuck about people. I don't care if you believe my story or not. I will never vote for NDP. 

I'd love to hear from someone who has seeked out an MPP for some sort of help and what the outcome was. I think we should all become more involved in who we vote for, by actually meeting these people and determining if they give a fuck about you or not.",0.09218750000000003,0.45677083333333324

A note about OW: Your account doesn't close as soon as you find employment. They like to keep the support coming for a few months until you're a little more confident where you are. 

Also, I don't know if they brought it up but if there's anything you need or simply think will help you, they have plenty of resources. I got a voucher for a new pair of glasses that actually just came in this week. I didn't absolutely need them but they made me look better than my old scuffed up pair.

6063,Big love to our TTC drivers,"Couple years back, end of December or January, late on a really cold snowy night (I think it was right before that big ice storm that knocked out a lot of power across the city). I was taking the bus when it stops and opens the door, but not at a stop. The bus driver shouts out to some woman who was trying to walk along the sidewalk (the snow was really thick, you could barely see where the sidewalk should be). I couldn't hear what she replied, but it sounded like she didn't have a fare to ride even if she wanted to. I just remember the driver saying ""Ma'am, it's too cold for you to be out walking through the snow all by yourself. Come inside, I'll drop you off wherever you need to go."" 

I saw where she got off and it probably would have taken at least an hour to trudge all the way there through the snow from where we picked her up, and it was definitely past -30 with the windchill.",-0.20142857142857143,0.4460714285714286

I saw another bus behind it which was rare because the bus comes every 10-15 minutes in the morning. I tried to run as best as I can with all the snow towards the stop.

I've seen way too many people lose their footing and go flying because the driver couldn't wait for literally five seconds.

And don't get me started on my fellow passengers... so many doors blocked, so many seats not given up, so many backpacks left on...

A group of hard-ass dudes stormed through the halls into one store and started ripping posters off the glass and carting out boxes of DVDs. You would've thought they were FBI agents - but what was hilarious was the jackets these men were all wearing said ""ANTI-PIRACY POLICE"" on the back and it was almost absurd. Like is that even a thing? Did they have these jackets made up specifically for raiding Pacific Mall? It was like something out of a bad movie.  The owner or employee of the store just kinda sat there with a bothered look on his face - the kind of face you make when your lottery ticket doesn't win, not happy, but not really shocked either. 

Also as this was happening - at least 10 other stores in the mall rushed to close up shop and lock their doors. I guess they figured if they appeared to be closed they would be left alone for the day.

6545,Majority of stores at Toronto Premium Outlet have stickered over cheaper prices or have changed tags for the Black Friday weekend just a heads up.,"I use to work in retail. I did it for over a decade in a wide variety of job titles (manager, visual merchandiser, sales associate, cashier, and overnight stock). Usually US brand tags (like Ralph Lauren) come with only the USD prices. **Most companies do NOT put stickers for Black Friday.** It's considered a waste of time and man power, stickering separate objects for what is at best a 1 week sale. Especially since you'd have to use the same time and effort to remove stickers off items that were not sold when the week is done. We tended to use bigger stickers, like the one posted to cover the USD prices. They adhere strongly and are exceptionally difficult to remove. Companies use smaller stickers on Black Friday deals for a two reasons. Smaller stickers are easier to remove and they allow the customer to see the discount they're getting.They want to see the exact amount right away, without all the thought. Usually, companies favour big signs at the front of a store stating the deals or signs on racks because they are the easiest methods of showing sales without going through each individual item. 

If this is where I think its from (Hudson's Bay) I have worked there. And can confirm that this is the sticker used to cover USD prices. Why it might not match up with the exchange rate is usually because HB doesn't get these kinds of US Brands (Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, etc) until they already on greater sale in the US. This might be last seasons item. Ralph Lauren will have already marked down the item in their own stores state side. Lets say RL has 1000 units of this top, for 40 bucks USD. But they aren't selling in their stores. So they put it on clearance for 20 bucks. And that gets them some sales but not enough to get rid of it all, and they're still left with 100 units. Instead of storing them, which is costly, or marking them down even further,(bleeding money) RL will show this to a buyer from HB, enticing them by saying ""You don't have to mark it all the way up to 55 CAD, you can price it however!"" The buyer from HB will then buy the 100 units and the company will calculate what they think they can sell it for (and still make profit) based on many different factors, and have associates price it at 44 CAD. 

TLDR: OP has most likely peeled off a regular priced item sticker and is just looking for attention. If you ever have a question about Black Friday sales, always ask an associate. They're drilled to know what is and isn't on sale, and how it will be marked, if at all. ",0.0755012531328321,0.4451425036951353

Okay I've made a [similar comment before](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/86cbrr/a_woman_tboned_my_car_at_lesliemajor_mackenzie_on/dw47pgr/) and I shall mention some of the same stuff in the context of this accident.

Know where you are driving. There are rules and norms here that make sense. This may or may not be LEGAL. But it's how you stay safe in a fast changing environment.

1) Pedestrians, keep an eye out, especially crossing intersection. In this particular circumstance the pedestrians have no responsibility as to what transpired. While technically illegal to cross on a flashing stop. This is norm in Toronto and drivers should recognize that, not take it as a moral high ground or a killing ground. However, to the pedestrians, you are the most vulnerable thing out there. If a person crashes their car, they might mess up their car and might have a bit of an injury. If they crash into you, you dead. Trust noone with your life. 

2) Driver 1 the Jeep - you fine. 0% responsible.

3) Driver 2 the rav4 or whatever: It's debatable if this guy entered the intersection on the yellow or before as it is behind the jeep and he's already in the crosswalk when we see it in the video. So it was probably fine for them to enter by legal standards. However, driving in Toronto the reality is most drivers will inch up on the yellow so that they can make the turn especially on large intersections if theres enough room for more car in the turning lane to be in the intersection. This guy by Toronto norms is fine and is probably not that responsible. By legal standards, depends on exactly when he entered the intersection. 

4) Driver 3 the red car: This asshole pushed his luck but these guys are a dime a dozen in Toronto. IMO This is the only guy in the turning lane that did osmehting that is illegal + not normal in Toronto (Ie people don't drive normally expecting that). Now if you are going to drive like this. And you see the guy barreling down trying to make the yellow, you put one food on the break and stop if that guy doesn't stop, he's going faster than you and it's very likely that he won't be able to stop if you enter. So don't fucking do this. This guy could have prevented the situation if he had watched that guy and stopped. Legally I'm not sure how much responsibility this guy carries but just by understanding how cars drive- this guy is at least somewhat responsible for the ensuing chaos.  

5) Driver 4 the real asshole: Going at that speed and only coming into the intersection at that time means this fucker was REALLY far away from it. Essentially an idiot or this person was intentionally trying to run the red. Again, if you are going to do this shit assess the situation, you see those turning late. Should have assumed that might still continue to go and slowed down to stop. This person could have definitely stopped way earlier. By Toronto driving norms this guy takes all the blame. Legally I guess it depends on how much they give to the red car.

Tips for finding a lost doggo:
- don’t panic. Dogs are excited to be free and on their own, but they are also smart! You dog will likely find a place for the night and become active again in the morning. 
- If there is a sighting DO NOT CHASE OR CALL THE DOG. Yes your dog loves you, but typically dogs will still run away from even the best owners.
- the best way to get the dog to come closer to you is to get low to the ground and act hurt. You can even let out a soft whimper. Typically this entices your dog to come to you more than calling them would.

My worst experience was when I was in high school taking the subway from downtown to go home. The subway announces that there's a delay and this guy starts ranting about the announcers thick accent before proceeding to continue on complaining about how immigrants are stealing ""their"" jobs and ruining the once great city of Toronto. At a certain point he starts throwing out racial slurs and he starts on a more specific rant about how there's too many chinks and all that good stuff. 


It wasn't a crowd subway car, and there was only about 15 -
 20 people in the same section as me. Of all the people I could see in my vicinity, I was the only Asian. I'm 95% certain the other passengers realized this as well because as he was ranting about Asian's stealing their jobs and eating their dogs, every other passenger started to look or glance at me. Some were more subtle about it but I could see all their eyes. To this day I remember it perfectly, including the somewhat sympathetic look from a white guy sitting a few seats away from me.

Something I doubt would happen seeing as no one believes mental health is an actual problem even though a great majority of humans have them. And too many people think addicted individuals are to blame for their addictions and shouldn't receive any public money help.  


If you decriminalize all drugs for personal use but then don't provide structured help for those that will need it, it could go sideways real quick. However, if the help is readily available due to increased budgets from the money saved by stopping this war on drugs endeavour, then we would be headed in the right direction.",0.1614795918367347,0.4483843537414966
7150,Toronto’s chief medical officer calls for decriminalization of all drugs for personal use,"I agree with folks here who are saying that decriminalization is a half-measure. 

The best analogy is Prohibition in America. During Prohihibition, black-market alcohol was all hard liquor and moonshine, because it was advantageous to smuggle a product that had more kick to it. As such, that was pretty much the only option for people. 

When alcohol became legal again, there wasn't a huge epidemic of alcohol users. In fact, many of the people who had been drinking hard liquor during Prohibition reverted to less-intoxicating options like beer and wine. 

The fact is, ~~most people are able to strike a balance between their recreational alcohol use, and keeping their lives on track. That has been true ever since alcohol became legal in the US, and it's the reason we aren't all passed out drunk at this very moment. 

Legalizing drugs would have the benefit of being able to ensure people were able to purchase an unadulterated product that performs as advertised. They would also be able to purchase the ""wine or beer"" versions of whichever substance they happened to favour. Most people would be able to keep their lives on track, and fend off the temptation of abusing hard drugs. 

It's true that some people would get addicted, just as it's true that some people are addicted to alcohol. 

But the enormous savings from not having to sink resources into enforcement would more than offset the cost of providing meaningful and effective treatment to these individuals. 

Also, these individuals being able to access their drug of choice in a safe and lawful manner would help them to address the underlying issues in their lives that cause them to abuse drugs in the first place. 

Legalize everything. ",0.2520833333333333,0.5655092592592593

> Toronto&#039;s chief medical officer is calling for the decriminalization - and potential legalization - of all drugs for personal use as a way to curb rising opioid-related deaths and overdoses.

> In a report released on Monday, Medical Officer of Health Eileen de Villa recommended the federal government scale up harm-prevention strategies, including the removal of legal penalties for small amounts of drugs, and convene a task force to look at the possibility of regulating all drugs, such as alcohol.

> After Portugal decriminalized drugs for personal use in 2001, new cases of HIV and AIDS among people with addictions declined year after year, and drug-related deaths dropped by 27.5 per cent from 1999 to 2006.

I agree and it's nice that someone helped out. We need this on a daily not once in a while . I get it. You don't have the job you want or make that money like you hoped.maybe you are depressed or have some sort of mental issue. And that includes my self . 


We all have issues to deal with on a daily basis,some are tougher then others. Do we get mad? Of course we do! . Do we tell people to fuck off sometimes or act rude to other ? Yes we do.

Life is life live it or don't but it's not your decision to take someone else's . We just need to chill , it's hard to do of course but being a stubborn miserable prick isn't going to make your life any better .

> StubHub fully supports legislation prohibiting the use of bots to procure tickets. Full stop.

A bit of a laugh considering the volumes some of their sellers are doing can really only come from bots.

> The original legislation required ticket sellers to disclose how many tickets were actually being made available for sale, a simple concept that would provide you better insight into the actual availability of tickets. This is the very issue the proposed legislation was trying to solve. Yet, the Government chose to remove this critical provision from the legislation, citing pressure from the live entertainment industry as a prevailing reason over establishing transparency for Ontario fans like you. 

While it's funny for StubHub to be calling for transparency - are they going to be more transparent about bulk selling and where tickets came from? - this is a good point. There's so little transparency around how many tickets are made available. That mystery enables the secondary market. Still, I understand the live event industry's desire to keep that information secret. Are other businesses required to tell you when products are becoming available or how they're selling them?

> This proposal stands to negatively impact Ontario fans like you and Ontario-based businesses like StubHub as ticket resales are driven off platforms that have robust consumer protections. Ticket resale prices will continue to be driven by supply and demand, not by arbitrarily set price caps. The fact is, if a venue holds 20,000 fans, but 100,000 fans want to attend the performance, ticket prices will reflect that demand. If the established market rate exceeds the 50% cap established by government, those sales won't stop or adapt to reflect the price caps – they'll just occur at their true value through channels the government cannot regulate.

The old Ticketmaster CEO has spoke about this in length on why you can't get front row tickets to shows. It's bots and a lack of tickets. Most tickets go to brokers, VIPs and corporations, so that the artists can save face and charge less than they should for tickets, but still guaranteeing themselves a pay day. You need to look no further than what Eric church did this past summer or what Taylor swift is doing now. They prices tickets properly and had access through proper channels so fans can get tickets. It's not societies issue, nor should it be regulated as a byproduct, if you don't have the wherewithal to get concert tickets. I've never had an issue. Ever. ",0.08047619047619048,0.30642857142857144

7462,I have a 40k income and I'm not priced out of this city.,"I think these posts need to be flagged with the age group of the poster. I know so many people who in their early 20s made entry-level white collar wages (around $30-40k in the early 2000s) that lived in basement apartments with hot plates and talked endlessly about shopping at no frills and value village. Most of these people are now married, have million dollar semis in the city or detached in the suburbs (granted I'm in the age group that bought before houses prices went completely insane) and live a pretty classic middle class life (we still don't have the cottages and such of the boomers though). This is usually a result of both the coupling of incomes and incomes rising as careers progress.

My point is that in their 20s, you take a certain pride in simply being independent and making it on your own. Reading many of these posts, I'm picturing most posters to be in their mid-20s.

Perhaps you are vs the average person's expectation of ""city life"" as per the movies?




I mean it works for you because you're Frugal AF, which I'm not saying is a bad thing, but in some cases, people migrating now from other provinces/townships/etc now to Toronto are screwed in different ways that ppl who've been here a while don't realize.




E.g. you managed to snag a place at IDK let's say St Clair & Caledonia for $900/mo for 1 bedroom in 2013. That rent only rose to $1,100/mo because it was in a rent-controlled building/your landlord didn't force high increases on you.




If you left your rental unit now, your landlord would try to rent to the next person (say some 19-year-old moving from King City to Toronto) at the current published average rent of $2,000/mo (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rent-expensive-toronto-2018-1.4491949) less say a 25% discount for the moderate-level of accessibility from that location. So they're looking at $1,500/mo when they see your unit listed on Kijiji/Cragislist/Padmapper etc.




That's a $400/mo difference for exactly the same unit!




Your life is great because you were in the right place at the right time and are frugal AF. For people moving now to Toronto, they have challenges and are def finding it harder to make ends meet.",0.06255359719645434,0.4605309901738474

However, when it comes down to it, living on 40k in Toronto should ideally only be a temporary situation, imho. Sure, it can keep a roof over your head (likely with roommates) and food on the table now, but if you look to the future you won't be able to save much for retirement or a downpayment. I'll be turning 28 soon and am single and child-free, living on about 45k pre-tax (approximately, as I'm an hourly employee). After my car insurance and gas (I need my car to commute to work), I don't have much left for savings, despite the fact that I live frugally. It often feels suffocating.

There's a quality of life balance, and where the $140k people were jackoffs, you kind of seem to be living the low-quality version of the same life, where you don't do anything.

The Liberal colours would get the attention of the typical Liberal voters and maybe a decent strategy.

But the intent is clearly more malicious and misleading.  They use words like ""join us"" and implying the ""us"" they are trying to portray is some group of Liberal voters (misleading you to believe who the ad is really from).  They make this intent to mislead readers more explicit by saying ""We are Liberal voters..."" (I doubt there are many ""Liberal voters"" that are part of the OPC's) and even further try to hide the fact (as best they can while following the rules) that the ad is paid for by the campaign of Pham.

The legality of the above part may not be questionable and not illegal.  I don't know what the laws are on election materials and how explicit they must make it.

That said, the line about Wynne conceding the specific riding in question is not true and a different story.

If I were in his ward, I'd be offended that he is trying mislead and trick me like this and wouldn't vote for him, even if I were a typical conservative voter (and if any other party pulled the same stunt, I'd apply the same reaction).",0.12318840579710146,0.4057971014492754

Here is what happened. On 01/30/18 I bought some broccoli form Freshco at Bloor&Dundas location. It was on sale, so I bought a lot and kept them in the fridge. Today morning when I cut one in half, I saw a litter black ball on the broccoli about one inch away from my finger. When I took a closer look, I realized it's a spider, and I suspect it's a black widow(I saw it on youtube b4). But the spider is not moving maybe because It was in the fridge for days. I thought it was dead so I grabbed my phone to take a pic and realized It is NOT dead. I then put the broccoli with the spider on it into a plastic box using a bbq tongue. After that, I checked all the remaining broccoli in the fridge for a spider.
More update I have filed a report on CFIA website. I will keep the spider until they contact me

Yesterday I got off at Osgoode station around 5:15 needing to go West down to Bathurst, I think I waited there for about 20 minutes before a streetcar came by that was completely full (even though that doesn't deter people from shoving their way onto the streetcar making everyone elses experience absolutely fantastic). Waited another 10 minutes for another one to come by that was also pretty full but I got on. Anyways, the waiting didn't piss me off, it was the fact that I counted 7 streetcars going East went by us over the half hour while only 2 came going West. 

I am getting to the point where once I get off at my regular get off station (St.Patrick) I am not even going to bother waiting for the streetcar going West, its faster to walk than it is taking the chance a streetcar will come by thats not completely jam pack full. 

edit: It seems to be a pretty regular occurance from my recent experiences that there are simply more streetcars going East at those times than there are going West, by a very large difference. The TTC are always trying to catch people who are sneaking on rides on the TTC yet how can they even monitor who is paying and who isn't when the streetcar is so jam packed that you can barely move let alone monitor who is paying and who isn't.

If you live in Toronto you have to live near a inner city GO train station, walking or cycle distance, or drive a car.  And it ain’t getting better.  The new streetcars and Eglinton crosstown will only ease it a little.  A DRL will take many decades to fund, plan, and build, and you will be close to retirement when it is done.  Yes, it should be built, but you have to come to terms that this is it for a very long time.  You got to move or cope somehow, and more people are coming.

My ass is likely going to KWC area.  Tonnes of work in diverse sectors, lowest unemployment in the province, housing is WAY cheaper, lots of countryside and trails nearby for recreation, very progressive city councils, LRT is almost complete, huge river to kayak in and jog by, no traffic and you can get anywhere quick, etc.  I am just done.  Toronto is living in a tiny condo, hauling heavy groceries up the street, overpriced everything, overcrowded streetcars, far from anything relaxing, and barely any money leftover (once you save for retirement) to do the stuff you moved here for.  It’s why all the restaurants and bars here are hurting, everyone is broke.  Even the cheap stuff is out of control.  Want to go to Centre Island on a hot Sunday, here have a two hour wait at the ferry dock.  The few things that are good I can AirBnB a pad for and then leave.

Toronto's been an absolute joke for public transportation for about 25 years now (thanks to Mike Harris mostly) and every time the conversation about building more subways comes up, everyone complains about costs while the problem just gets worse and worse.

Why keep talking about the past and looks forward at the future?

We should be celebrating All Nationality Month as the past generations are behind us and sure we have a few racist cults and so on.

But it is the 21st century and people are nicer to each other, dating outside your race is acceptable, non-judgemental and who you hang out with nowadays has no bearing on discrimination.

The same can be said about the Holocaust too. It’s the past and majority that live those horrible days are no longer with us.

There is still more work in progress but celebrating this every year is just a reminder of the darker days in society.

Learning and understanding these moments in a educational school is where it should be kept because we don’t really celebrate a month of the birth of Canada, Remembrance Day, The Natives or another importance events which are  just 1 day event or just totally forgotten.

Sorry to be prude but stuff like the #MeToo movement is a forward progression in equal rights to equal pay that should of been fix a long time ago.

Legalization of Marijuana is a forward movement but should be treated like alcohol for laws regarding work, machinery and operating a vehicle.

Those are events we should be celebrating as present not the past to reflex on the positive changes.

There are many positive things to come but to hover over the past is a step backwards in society and just create unnecessary tension to reflex on the bad times.",-0.07971117424242423,0.4032749368686868

Some of y'all dont seem to understand.,"Back in the early 90s, my dad and I were driving north on Warden Avenue, and as we came to Ellesmere, the lights were out.

I believe this intersection is often on the list of most dangerous intersections because the roads come down into this intersection and it can be hard to see some cars coming.

As we approached this intersection, with the lights flashing red, people going east and west were just flying through it at top speed. 

Finally there is a small break and a few people going East and West did stop, so a cars going south and north begin to go, and then other cars going East and West fly through, narrowly avoiding T-boning other cars. Then those N and S cars finally start to move, but the stopped E and W cars are impatient, and begin to push their way into the intersection.

I was only 14 or 15 at the time, but even I knew that this was a total shit show, and only a matter of time before someone smashed into someone else. Thankfully we made it through that intersection carefully, and carried on our way.

It just amazes me that people can't grasp a simple concept ""Is what I am doing safe? or could I potentially be putting myself or others in danger""

That is a pretty simple concept, but for some, the ""ME FIRST, ME FIRST, FUCK YOU ALL, ME FIRST"" overrides that, because shit, Survivor is on at 8pm, and I gots to be home.

Last night I was leaving the area around Pearson (driving) and came to an intersection where the lights were off, no cop directing. I stopped, looked around.

I presume this is where most of the difficulty in navigating a multi-lane 4-way stop comes from, isn't it?

Are Toronto roads set up in a way where one can generally simply go one street past where they wanted to turn left, make a right, make another right, and make a final right onto the original street they go left on? Would that not be far safer and easier? Or does the road layout generally not make that feasible? Or does it just take too long?",0.12551020408163266,0.5260204081632653

1) A lot of Security companies hire anyone with a license..experience or no experience. Training isn’t the best and many lack the abilty to properly communicate with the parties involved in a physical/verbal altercation.

2) The laws in place actually prevent a security guard from getting involved physically if neccessary. Many don’t know but one example is mall security by law don’t have the right to physcially escort you out of a mall or even put their hands on you. They could get charged with assault for doing so if the indiviual wants to press charges. When working at a site (bar, club, etc) that is working under the ontario liquor act it allows the security guard to remove an indiviual by the necessary but reasonable amount of force when necessary.

This is what too much drink does to people, destroying inhibitions that lets internal feelings a person keeps under wraps and turns into horror and violence towards anybody they might feel remotely against or offended by.

Ethanol intoxication behind the wheel of a car turns that car into a weapon instead of a car. That this individual is not behind the wheel of a car makes him no less dangerous. And keep in mind: alcohol, sadly, is entirely legal. Hell, I'd rather have this guy chain-smoking a pack of cigarettes instead of tossing back a few fingers of whiskey or a six-pack of beer, even if we're choosing between lung cancer or emphysema, or cirrhosis of the liver a chronic alcoholic might end up having; at least a cigarette is a lot less likely to mess with your head and incite the kind of violent behaviour shown by the guy in the OP's video. 

The horrible thing about a situation like this is that the police are only authorized to do so much, more or less just getting the guy to move away from the folks he harassed, without actually being charged with something (although, based on what was shown in the video, he could've easily been facing assault charges combined with public drunkenness) until and unless he broke a law, like assaulting someone or worse, somewhere other than this.

8444,Ontario just made $15 minimum wage official,"Is it okay to hate this idea, and still be interested in Liberal-minded ideas and solutions to the economic disparity between the have's and have-not's?

I don't think that it's a ""conservative"" conspiracy to think that this ultimately results is an extra inflation against everyone above minimum wage who have to eat whatever price increases result from this, or whatever additional social security is needed as jobs are shed by companies that need or want to maintain their current margins.

I think that the motivation behind instituting this wage increase is to combat the effect of corporatism.  These large companies in no way are going to just eat the extra costs without finding some way to maintain their current profit margin and look for new ways to increase their profit margin (as the stock market system dictates they must.)

So... I think the real solution involves attacking corporatism in a different way.

1) institute laws that dictate realistic CEO-to-employee earning ratios so that the hard work of the individuals is more closely tied to the success of the company, and therefore the CEO

2) figure out how to close the loopholes that allow corportations and rich indiviuals to avoid taxes by extricating their money out of our country to tax havens

3) have the most generous business tax cuts in the Western world, but those tax cuts are strictly tied to the creation of full-time jobs.  Create more full-time employment and you unlock greater tax cut benefits... reduce full-time employment and see your tax cut benefits go away.

Anyway, just my thoughts.

As a food truck owner my employees make more than I do. In fact I charge $11 a meal on average and almost break even with no pay for myself.  I hope each ear that it picks up and I can take a pay check but in years now it has not happened.  This is the reality of many many business owners. $15 min wage is not the only part that raises prices.
I have to raise say 50 cents a meal to cover it.  But do does my delivery guy and the butcher and the farmer.  In the end it's a $2 raise because of each business raising it.

So next year if I sell my same meal at $13 I will not have increased the price at all. Just covered costs and I will still make no money for myself.

Large businesses may have millions to cover it and in theory it's fine for Walmart but small businesses have to raise prices or go out of business.   And McDonald's will only raise their price by $1 instead of 2 so now I can't even be competitive.

People who talk on here like it won't affect small businesses have their heads up their ass, unless the common consumer chooses to come to small businesses and boycott McDonald's , Walmart and the like. This is blatently bad for your local business.",0.01443452380952382,0.457514880952381
