51,Local business no longer allowed to donate unsold food,"> We recognized that our ability to maintain safe food handling during the transportation of prepared food was not adequate. As a result, we are presently not accepting certain prepared food items until we are able to upgrade our current infrastructure.

I've had to use their food bank a few times.  The pizzas were always stacked on the floor, at room temp, beside racks of withered produce and/or bread riddled with insects.  The canned food was distributed one-per, but the rest of it was free for people to paw through at their leisure.

I don't really know about the transport, though.  Seems like they're concerned about the pizza becoming warm in transport, then maybe cold in a walk-in fridge/freezer, then warm again sitting on the floor in the basement.   Then, consider that it may be thawed and cooled another once or twice before it finds a stomach, depending on how busy the place is.",0.18554421768707482,0.4914115646258503

408,I’m not paying my taxes until this is a thing in Ottawa,">  Dear Diary
> 
>   **Aug. 12** - Moved to our new home in Canada. I am so excited. It's so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can hardly wait to see them with snow covering them.

>    **Oct. 14** - Canada -- it is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves have turned all colors and shades of red and orange. Went for a ride through the beautiful countryside and saw some deer. They are so graceful. Certainly they are the most wonderful animals on earth. This must be paradise. I love it here!

>    **Nov. 11** - Remembrance Day. Deer season starts soon. I can't imagine anyone wanting to kill such a gorgeous creature. Hope it snows soon. I love it here!

>    **Dec. 2** - It snowed last night. Woke up to find everything blanketed with white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and shoveled the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won). When the snow plough came by we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I love Canada!

>   **Dec. 12** - More snow last night. The snow plough did his trick again to the driveway. I love it here.

>    **Dec. 19** - More snow last night. Couldn't get out of the driveway to get to work. It's beautiful here but I'm exhausted from shoveling. F#cking snow plough.

>    **Dec. 22** - More of that white shit fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands and a sore back from shoveling. I think the snow plough hides around the corner until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Asshole.

>    **Dec. 25** - Merry F#cking Christmas! More frigging snow. If I ever get my hands on the sonovabitch who drives the snow plough, I swear I'll kill the bastard. Don't know why they don't use more salt on the roads to melt the f#cking ice.

>    **Dec. 27** - More white shit last night. Been inside for three days now except for shoveling out the driveway after that snow plough goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, the car's stuck in a mountain of white crap and it is so frigging cold. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of the crap again tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow 10 inches is?

>    **Dec. 28** - That f#cking weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the crap this time. At this rate it won't melt before summer. The snow plough got stuck up in the road and that bastard came to my door and asked to borrow my shovel. After I told him that I had already broken six shovels shoveling out all the crap he had pushed into my driveway, I damn near broke my last one over his f#cking head.

>    **Jan. 4** - Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get food and on my way back a damned deer ran in front of the car. Did about $3,000 damage to the car. Those beasts should be killed. The bastards are everywhere. Wish the hunters had
> exterminated them all last November.

>    **May 3** - Took the car to the garage in town. Would you believe the thing is rusted out from all that salt they put all over the roads.

>    **May 10** - Moved to Florida. I can't imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever want to live in such a God forsaken place as Canada!",0.14791334396597552,0.498596870965292

As someone that used to live in a city with a subway (Montreal), and has used several (NYC, Paris, LA, Toronto, London), it is remarkably efficient as a means of public transit.  The problem is as of late is that governments(federal, provincial, municipal) are slow to invest in said infrastructure.  Decades can go by...

Ottawa is lucky because they've managed to get by on a Rapid Bus Network/System, but the recent investment into the O-Train is a huge step forward for the city's growth and future.  Train's are much more efficient and cheaper than underground subway's.  Hopefully they'll further integrate the systems with STO and also the outer suburbs like Barrhaven, Kanata, and South/Southeast. In due time.

1059,Everyone has seen this beast lol.,">Every year Thanksgiving night we flocked out behind Dad as he dragged the Santa suit to the road and draped it over a kind of crucifix he'd built out of metal pole in the yard. Super Bowl week the pole was dressed in a jersey and Rod's helmet and Rod had to clear it with Dad if he wanted to take the helmet off. On the Fourth of July the pole was Uncle Sam, on Veteran’s Day a soldier,  on Halloween a ghost. The pole was Dad's only concession to glee. We were allowed a single Crayola from the box at a time. One Christmas Eve he shrieked at Kimmie for wasting an apple slice. He hovered over us as we poured ketchup saying: good enough good enough good enough. Birthday parties consisted of cupcakes, no ice cream. The first time I brought a date over she said: what's with your dad and that pole? and I sat there blinking.

>We left home, married,  had children of our own, found the seeds of meanness blooming also within us. Dad began dressing the pole with more complexity and less discernible logic. He draped some kind of fur over it on Groundhog Day and lugged out a floodlight to ensure a shadow. When an earthquake struck Chile he lay the pole on its side and spray painted a rift in the earth. Mom died and he dressed the pole as Death and hung from the crossbar photos of Mom as a baby. We'd stop by and find odd talismans from his youth arranged around the base: army medals, theater tickets, old sweatshirts, tubes of Mom's makeup. One autumn he painted the pole bright yellow. He covered it with cotton swabs that winter for warmth and provided offspring by hammering in six crossed sticks around the yard. He ran lengths of string between the pole and the sticks, and taped to the string letters of apology, admissions of error, pleas for understanding, all written in a frantic hand on index cards. He painted a sign saying LOVE and hung it from the pole and another that said FORGIVE? and then he died in the hall with the radio on and we sold the house to a young couple who yanked out the pole and the sticks and left them by the road on garbage day.

I am blown away by the amount of people who are there to help!","Full disclosure: this morning I was out looking for meow. I saw a woman walking with her dog and decided to ask her if she had seen any black cats in the area.
She was kind enough to offer help placing more posters in the area.
Upon leaving to make more posters later in the day I showed my brother the location of the house, where we would drop off the posters to the woman who was going to help.
My brother had this sudden urge to check by this house nearby. He started to call out meows name.
A black cat started to poke her head out from under a porch. She cautiously started to meow! Finally she got exited and started to meow louder and more frequently! And my brother picked her up and it was meow!
I couldn't believe it at first. I thought there was no way that it was meow.
That there was no way we just found her.
I started to have mini explosions of excitement!
Holy crap I finally realized! This is actually meow! We just found her!
We brought her home and her daughter monster STARTED LOSING HER MIND!
She smelled her, and knew it was her.
She started brushing up to her and running around.
It was a real tear jerker seeing the whole thing. My brother and I have both had meow for a long time. My brother suffers from severe depression. And losing meow tore him apart. Finding her and watching the joy return to our lives really made my day! ",0.115625,0.4795454545454545

I hope they don’t hurt him further. 

It’s really kind and brave of the first people who saw him to work together to block him in so that he doesn’t get hit by a car. 

Poor guy though; he must be so scared.

Edit: My spouse advised me this afternoon that the poor moose was euthanized, and I see from the comments below that others have read the same reports. 😢 It’s so unfortunate that the poor guy had to suffer from so much anxiety and pain before his tragic death. I know people will joke and say he’s “just a wild animal with no feelings,” but there is something so enchanting about mammals we rarely see, and to find out that one has been killed after wandering into space occupied by humans is just really, really sad. What’s worse is that this happened on the fringes of the greenbelt, which forms part of the habitat that this guy and other mammals, reptiles and amphibians live in; he wandered out, hurt his leg, and then died. 😢 Rest in peace, big guy.",-0.08943181818181818,0.5541666666666666

This deer and some others wanted to pass through this area, between a creek and a fence. I really hoped they would with these conditions as a backdrop. They were pretty hesitant, but I pretended to pick and eat grass, look into the distance, and scratch myself lol. Basically just foraging like they were, and eventually they wandered through.

Warning, tech talk beyond this point:


I put the shutter speed fast, at 1/1000, so I could at least get a pic of them running if they decided to. And I was at f/9 by accident, as I was shooting landscapes before they showed up. This made the image pretty noisy, but I do like the level of focus in the background.

* They don't know how to compete.
* Their most relevant, potentially competitive products (such as on-demand services) are terrible, require expensive hardware, and still feature unskipable advertising in spite of being a paid service.
* They refuse to pay for or lease competitor content to stream over their broadband services -- and their competitors are doing so well doing exactly that (over Bell's broadband services, lol).  Effectively making it difficult for customers to buy content they actually want.
* They are afraid to invest in their own industry and infrastructure after wasting enormous wealth buying out all the small on-demand startups from the early 2000s, and failed to turn a decent product.
* And thus, they are turning to rent-seeking, protectionist practices because their shit is so awful, they can't even compete with some shady website with broken links, poorly compressed video, bitcoin mining javascript, suspicious downloads and porn banner advertising.

Please stop walking in the middle of paths, and if there are two of you walking together, scootch the fuck over or walk single file for 15 seconds so people aren't squeezing onto a curb to get by. 
   
Follow the rules of right of way- pedestrians don't have luxury of a 4000 pound machine to cover any mistakes about a drivers intentions, so just *drive your fucking car* and let them worry about crossing the street cause it's wasting everybodys time as we all stare at each other. Trust me, I'm not just going to sprint into traffic. Stop waving people around like a traffic conducter, I'm pretty sure it's literally illegal to do so and also I don't trust some rando in his 2007 loser cruiser to get me across a road safely so you're being ignored anway.
  
Old people, if someone has headphones in, they don't want to talk to you about the farmers market or how bright the moon is tonight.

People under 30 have likely worked a lot of retail in their life- meeting new people and having inane, useless conversations loses it's charm after several thousand repetitions, and random passers by do not owe you a conversation so don't persist after them. Just... chill, yo.

Let's be honest with each other.  MADD's Drink/Drive campaign has been around for at least 30 years and we've hit a plateau for the reduction of accidents and deaths.  Every month there is an article in the news about a driver getting caught for the 6th, 7th or 12th time driving impaired.  And not slightly over the limit but rather shockingly well beyond the limit.  These people don't care.

That said, the same applies to Distracted Driving.  The fine and points and punishment won't make a difference.  It's just the reality.  People are too selfish and self absorbed to care.  They won't change their habits or choices.

Furthermore ... does it really matter?  According to this [CBC article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/opp-distracted-driving-death-1.4019014) these were the contributing factors for fatal collisions in Ontario for the year 2016:

* 65 distracted driving
* 55 speed-related
* 53 seat-belt related
* 45 alcohol-related

Sure distracted is at the top of the list but at a grand total of 216 people killed in Ontario from vehicle accidents is it statistically possible to get a reduction in numbers?  I would wager that it's unlikely.",0.018421052631578953,0.6108187134502924

2402,In case you didn't hear about the new Ontario distracted driving rule taking effect.,"This isn't an excuse, but I feel like the City's shitty transit infrastructure is likely a significant contributor to people using their phones. Driving home in the evening tends to be a much longer than necessary drive for tons of people in the city. I for one, am stuck at 4 different lights on my way home, each one taking about 8-10 minutes to get through due to crappy traffic. Add in all of the construction that happens in the summer, and almost every route home is clogged. 

People understandably, hate not moving in a vehicle. So what do they do? Pull out their phone to look for alternative routes home (google traffic, waze, etc..). Or maybe to put on music, read a text, etc.. I'm not justifying the usage - but I don't think significantly increasing the fines are going to help prevent phone usage in vehicles. Well, at least not until the odd person gets caught. Couple dozen people getting caught here and there, by an understaffed police force isn't going to fix the problem. Helping the flow of traffic would go a longer way in making road safety improve.

When I heard the news and how many people were affected it bothered me and I couldn’t help to think what if. What if more people were to speak out sooner? Would there have been less victims? I understand that people in power have more control which makes the problems harder to fix but change doesn’t happen on its own and I was shocked to hear how long that was going on for. It’s sad to hear about the female athletes and what they had to go through. I apologize to anyone I offended. I just feel like there were people who at the time men and women who could’ve done more at the time to prevent the damage that he caused and I do believe they deserve some blame for allowing him to do what he did. ,0.07055555555555554,0.5888888888888889

2902,Helped out a homeless person today in the Byward market.,"I worked at one of the shelters here I town for couple of years.  Most of the guys are just trying g to get by.  They have their problems, addictions, mental illness, etc.  But they're really not much different than your or I. 

There is a very fine line that most people don't realize exists between living in society, and falling out of it.  And once you fall out, if you dont have support, is next to impossible.  It's IS possible, but man, you have to WANT it at a level most of us can't appreciate.

The problem is, the system is kind of set up against having support.  Couples don't have anywhere to go.  If you have a pet, forget it, you're on the street.  Family members can't even be told if you're at a shelter, even if they're looking for you.  That welfare check goes mostly to the shelter you're staying in.  You'll be lucky to see $100 of you're monthly stipend. It's tough.

I used to live in the market by the 3 shelters and encountered many people with the same stories (need to make a call and need money, need some money for food, coffee, bus ticket to gatineau, etc). Some of these guys, I’d give money to on the first day i’d see them but over time you recognize their faces and see they’re doing it every single day and realize they probably won’t use the money for whatever they say they will. 

Once when I was walking home past the shepherds of good hope quite late at night after a class and quite a few guys were starting to harass me walking up to me and trying to touch me. It was scary to say the least. One guy came up next to me and started walking with me while shooing away the other guys. He walked me home about 3 blocks and I tried to thank him but realized he’s deaf and doesn’t speak. He still lives in and out of the shelter and whenever I see him, I give him a bill or two to help him out.

2905,Helped out a homeless person today in the Byward market.,"I think the point made in some other threads is that by handing money to a demographic that is known to have problems with addiction is that you aren't helping them at all. You are harming them by enabling the addiction to continue. It is better to give money to organizations that help or purchase specific items in need. 

Unless the person is deeply held by their addiction, it is spotted primarily by behaviour. This includes the person becoming an expert at lying and manipulation. Most of us aren't trained to spot this. It doesn't imply that all homeless have addiction but the rates are known to be higher. 

If you hand an addict cash, you're harming them. This is the advice given by healthcare professionals. ",0.246875,0.46875
2906,Helped out a homeless person today in the Byward market.,"good on yah for doing that, not many would.  I'll agree the homeless shelters downtown are a troubling spot and I hope one day the city considers them more of a temporary solution than a long term solution.  Need more permanent housing instead of the endless cycle of  - fall into a deep hole, turn to drugs/alcohol or other additions (dopamine kick, adrenaline etc..) then turn to crime to pay for it all then off to jail sooner or later everyone gets caught for the crime... etc... never ending cycle.      Gotta catch people as they fall or some will continue to fall hard if they don't have the means,skills,tools,resources,direction,help, etc...  
To the point of no return many fall into.  Then the streets just become the norm with never ending cycles of dependency and a deep deep hole of disparity which is near impossible to jump out of (the sht gets too deep)  



Many have some wicked stories - of rape, neglect, rejection, abuse etc...     
I've talked to many of them.  From a fella that turned to drugs at age 13 ... he'd wait for his mom each night as she went out prostituting herself. Turned to gangs to prove worth then after years of drugs etc... turned to the streets...  .   To a guy who turned to drinking, his dad used to get them to clean up the mess of blood in the house after he beat the crap out of everyone.    To another guy that took a nail gun to his head just missing a major vein as he went through his 3rd divorce and lost his company (yard-art-in-carp-on-26623), turned to the streets as he lost it all.  To a guy who found his mom dead and thought it was his fault, he was shipped off to relatives because his dad couldn't handle life anymore and turned to drinking.  To another guy from up north that turned to crack - got raped by the cops, by adults etc... lived on the streets for the past 20 years.   
Some wicked stories out there.  Really wicked.

Good on yah for doing that, yah can't really understand something until you've put yourself in others shoes for a day.  Of which many don't - many assume and ignorance is bliss many times.  
Quick to judge quick to anger many are, slow to understand.... 
ignorance and prejudice and fear walk hand in hand.

I was out at 4am and noticed all these cop cars circling those two streets. I thought it was a murder or something... then I turned on the news when I got home and they said it was a bear in a tree.

The bear must of been scared shitless... it doesn't know human rules, just after some treats?

kind of wonder how it got over the bridges for I suspect this bear might of came over from the park?

I encounter bear a few times a year. Most recently this spring when a momma bear and her cub were heading for the same trail head as I was (was with the dog)... luckily I saw them before we met up for the dog would want to play, who knows what would have happened then.
Worst encountered was mountain biking up at the firetower late one evening and a momma bear got up on her hind legs as her cubs went up in the trees. For the most part they are scared shitless of us and run off, unless they are a fed bear (due to human carelessness)...

luckily they didn't kill the thing and did the right thing by calling in the conservation people - at least they're good for something...

but, it sure did take a lot of cops to carry that bear out, hate to see what happens if they ever encounter a bear in the wild.

so decoupled from nature we are now...  ",0.08962842712842713,0.5104617604617605

Some intersections need to have their lights properly coordinated. Such as the shit show at the Nicholas and Nicholas southbound just before Laurier. You get three light cycles there for every one at Nicholas/Laurier, so mostly trucks and buses just pack that intersection and nothing moves. 

When light coordination and cycles are bad, it leads to problems all the way down the streets, then impatient people do stuff like this.

3273,"I am going to work at the election poll now, please get out and vote.","So I recently got back from a polling station and was genuinely shocked at the lack of knowledge (training?) of the staff on their job, it's processes, and the level of bureaucracy that must have spun up the whole thing.

A couple ahead of me had lived in the district for over 8 years and didn't get their voters card. As they were in the process of validating their information they were told they were listed under a different stations voter list and would have to be directed there. This conversation took about 10 minutes. They departed and went to that location, and I waited  while the staff of all 3 registration desks debated for another 15 minutes on whether or not they could have voted there. Eventually one of the staff pulled out a handbook, double checked his computer program and found out how to void them at the other station and vote here instead.

I'm a fairly recent resident of Ontario and decided to register as a voter at the polling station, as is clearly stated on the elections Ontario FAQ page.  I lined up at the desk that had a giant banner over it saying ""People who do not have a voter information card, or wish to register as a voter: Line up here"". I am completely astounded when the person manning the desk says he isn't sure if I can register to vote (be added to the list) there, advises I should have done it prior, and has to ask his supervisor if it's possible. When he is advised it is, he stumbles his way through the process and digital forms seemingly for the first time. During the process he asks me several times if I had been directed to vote at this station, to which I reply that obviously I hadn't since I wasn't a registered voter but that I did however, live 400m away.

After I complete the forms we spend 5-10 minutes because the form I had to sign wouldn't print, only to discover he hadn't been (or know how to) pressing the print button on the form.

I understand that there are kinks to work out but were there no practices or trial runs before game day? Did elections Ontario provide any training, or just grab people off the sidewalks (or local job bank sites) the day before?",0.007015810276679838,0.4121980676328503

Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions.

I would also be interested to know how many of these new condos are being purchased and used as the primary residence for citizens of Ottawa, and how many are being poached and rented for a profit. 

A couple of person anecdotes regarding renting in Ottawa:

We went for a viewing for a two-bedroom in Centretown. Nothing special, it was actually quite old. We decided to just take it and contacted the landlord. She informed us that her process is to take a $200.00 ""application deposit"" from all interested parties and then allow them to *bid* on the apartment. 

More recently, we filled out a lengthy application for an apartment. They asked for our references and pay stubs after, which we provided. Then they asked for a certified cheque for the amount of a month's rent, which we provided. *Then* they asked for proof of tenant insurance for the prospective apartment, which they hadn't even agreed to rent to us yet! Still, we were in too deep so we provided that as well. Finally, they had everything they asked for and I was eager to sign the lease. They informed me that it takes their office a while to prepare new leases, and I could sign it on *move-in day*, which was about 7 weeks away.

- Families with young kids that aren't rich
- Working class people 

This creates a particular kind of neighbourhood, which you can see on full display in Westboro and some other central neighbourhoods. There's a squeeze on working class and traditionally middle class folks. And of course there's a squeeze on students everywhere.

If the city is serious about working- and middle-class housing, it should consider offering incentives (e.g., tax breaks) to developers willing to build affordable units. Left entirely to the free market, densification will just mean luxurification. Depends on what kind of a city you want, I guess.

Ottawa's housing market is in a pretty good place compared to other cities in Canada, it could be cheaper but things are very affordable outside of the core areas. And the core areas (Centretown/Market) are in heavy demand for 2 reasons: they're the easiest places to live without owning a car, and they're within walking distance of many major employers.

There are many ways to keep housing prices in check though, and none of them are mutually exclusive.

- Just let developers build until its no longer profitable. The main driver of prices is still supply and demand, and developers aren't in the business of building housing that people don't want.
- Vacancy Tax. Maximize the supply of rental units by taxing any units that are unoccupied for more than 6 months.
- Land Value Tax. Basically, if property taxes were based more on the unimproved value of the land rather than the building on it, it would encourage densification in the most desired areas. Glebe-ites would HATE this though.
- Forcing developers to sell at below-market rates wouldn't work (people would just buy and resell at market rates), but you can offer per-unit subsidies or tax breaks to developers to encourage them to build smaller, more affordable units.
- Keep building reliable mass transit out to the suburbs, allowing for denser development around transit hubs.

In the end though, everyone wants a single-family home in a core area, and there simply isn't enough land for it. You aren't going to be able to buy one cheap, ever.

One selfish developer and an idiot Ottawa Councilwoman will waste millions upon millions of minutes of people's time. Because they don't care about people's free time going to and from work. This is what drives people out of a city. This is what drives house prices down because people don't need traffic jams if they can easily be avoided. ",-0.15597222222222226,0.5722222222222222

Many places have done this and its a mess.   Try getting around in panama for example, that place is just a concrete mess of traffic.  Can't even walk in that city its so congested and doesn't flow well.
So, need smart growth not just growth for the sake of growing, that just leads to stupidity.

I'd personally never buy a condo, its never ending assessments and condo fees.  Been there done that.  No more.
That massive monster building going up on preston is going to look funny, I think it will have a hell of a time fitting in.  And, who would live there - taking an elevator up 50+ flights then comes parking in the area.  Wish they would develop lebreton flats in a smart manner, those places are ugly.  I was hoping they would be a bit more than what they are.  Then comes the new Zibi site, that should be interesting.  Hopefully they widen the bridge for capacity and hopefully they add in some cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.  Would be nice if they put in a cycling pedestrian infrastructure where the prince of whales bridge is, since they closed that its falling apart as punks are stealing the wood and burning it etc...  

Anyhow, comes down to proper capacity planning, growing smartly, having sufficient services and businesses (look at preston, there is no real place to shop around there yet they are putting up monster buildings everywhere).   Need to develop in a smart way, not just for the sake of the almighty buck - quick growth.

3532,On this day in 1900: The Great Fire of Ottawa-Gatineau,"April 26th 1900

What began as a small chimney fire quickly spread into a raging inferno. The blaze – soon to be known as the Great Fire - would engulf two-thirds of Hull, numerous mills at Chaudière Falls, and much of LeBreton Flats.

The fire spread rapidly as near gale force winds whipped up flames, spreading burning embers and debris far and wide, destroying the massive lumber piles that lined the Ottawa, the wooden tenements of the working-class of the Flats, and the palatial homes of lumber barons J.R. Booth and Erskine Bronson. Thousands were left homeless and unemployed. Remarkably, only seven people were killed, however, in the following weeks more would die of disease in the unsanitary tent cities that were erected to house the destitute and homeless. The scale and severity of the Great Fire drew international attention and donations and relief poured in from around the world.

The fire marked the beginning of the end for an already declining lumber industry. Most of the mills at the Chaudière Falls were destroyed and the opposition to massed piled lumber within city limits was strengthened. The only lumber barons to rebuild after the fire were E.B. Eddy and J.R. Booth.

In the case of your colleague, I suspect the services of an Immigration Lawyer could be helpful as it really does seem like an absolute outlier as to why he has a 5 year ban.

- Have your passport and declaration forms ready in hand and immediately present them to the officer.
- Do not speak unless spoken to past saying ""Hello"", ""Good Morning"", etc...
- Do not ask questions.
- Do not attempt to have a conversation.
- Do not make jokes.
- Answer any questions posed in as clear and concise a form as possible. Do not provide _any_ additional information unless specifically asked.
- Know your DOB, Employer's full name (i.e. IBM Canada vs IBM), and immigration status of any immediate family members (i.e. parents, siblings, children).
- Know your exact destination, any connecting flights, etc... and be positive that what you say matches what you put on your declaration form.
- If you are traveling for work, ensure that you are not doing anything that would require a VISA (i.e. you're traveling for meetings), or you have the proper VISA to allow you to work (e.g. L1, H1B, TN, etc...) and have all associated paperwork/forms (e.g. SoW, 797, etc...).


If you are driving across the border:

- You are still being filmed/recorded constantly despite being in your car.
- Do not horse around in your car, yell, etc... when approaching the checkpoint.
- Ensure that you know the make and model of your car as well as your license plate #. Also be sure that you have your ownership and insurance papers available in the event they're requested.

If you are detained for questioning/secondary inspection:

- Remain calm. It's going to be a long and boring wait, but it'll get sorted out one way or another.
- All of the above notes still apply. 
- You will almost definitely miss your flight, but don't panic, the airline will sort it out - take this as a lesson learned for your future crossings. Hopefully you don't get stuck for too long.
- Parts of your car and/or luggage may be dismantled. The officers are _not_ obligated to put things back the way they were. Do not make a fuss if this happens, it's just going to make things more frustrating. If anything is damaged, you can file with them for compensation - yelling/complaining/etc... will get you absolutely nowhere.

Final notes:

- Ensure your passport is valid for at least the next 6 months. If it is less than that, ensure that your return date is prior to 2 months before expiry. If this is not the case, you may be refused entry.
- If you have a set travel date, you can get a rush on your passport renewal/application and sometimes get a new one on the same day or the following day. In worst case scenarios, temporary paperwork can generally be provided (I believe).

Most customs officers are just as bored with their job as you are with dealing with them, but they're also under a fair amount of stress to catch even minute things (think ""Papers, please"" the video game). It's in your, and their, best interest to keep the experience as streamlined as possible. Occasionally you'll find someone who seems to be far more uptight than others - I'm pretty sure there's a pool to see who has to do this each day :P - but just remember they're just trying to do their job as well and you're one of hundreds/thousands that they'll deal with.",0.08936480186480189,0.48819444444444443

I do understand that it is also very intimidating when being questioned with a stoic deadpan guard. You know people generally aren't so blunt, and it's a natural reaction to try to steer the conversation into a more light-hearted interaction.

3938,Ottawa mosque loses charity status for promoting ‘hate and intolerance’,"Hold on a minute.  It's easy to feel good about this because the overall impression seems to be that a mosque that promotes hate is facing consequences as a result.  But, some of the details of this bother me.

For one, it seems strange that the CRA is the one deciding this sort of thing, but the police are apparently not involved.  If the CRA can remove an org's charitable status, is there a trial?  Do you have the right o defend yourself?

Hate speech is illegal, so if one federal agency (CRA) has enough evidence of hate speech to remove charitable status, another one (RCMP) should be able to use that evidence to prosecute people.

If they went the other direction it would make more sense.  If the RCMP investigated and found the Mosque promoted hate speech they could charge people for something.  The CRA could then use any convictions resulting from that to remove the charitable status.

Without that, it seems up to the interpretation of someone within CRA.

I'm not sure I believe this, but someone from the mosque claims:

> Assalam mosque officials said the auditors had not alleged that any of the guest speakers had made hateful comments while at the mosque, only that they had made them elsewhere and had been invited to speak at the mosque.

Let's say that's true.  Should the mosque lose charitable status based on the identities of the people it invites, even if those people preach love and happiness at the mosque?

What if someone ran a community centre that was a charity and invited a former terrorist to give a speech on how he was radicalized, how he overcame it, and what to do to kids who are in danger of becoming radicalized.  Could the CRA remove the community centre's charitable status for something that speaker had said at another point in his/her life?

To take things to extremes, consider this.

In May of this year there was a debate at Roy Thomson Hall between Stephen Fry and Jordan Peterson on one side and Michael Eric Dyson and Michelle Goldberg on the other about political correctness.

Could The Corporation of Massey Hall and Roy Thomson Hall lose its charitable status because someone at CRA decided that inviting Jordan Peterson to speak there constituted inviting someone who promoted misogynist speech?

I would hope not, but who decides?  Is there a certain number of speakers you have to have to reach a threshold where it's not OK?  Is there a certain degree of hate speech those speakers had to use before it's not ok to invite them?  Does it matter if they said anything hateful at the site in question?",0.08118386243386246,0.5882164902998238

However, I think most if not all people figured 10 tickets included would be 10 samples yet it was only 5 and let's be honest they weren't that large.

I had a good time trying out new beers and I ended up buying an extra 6 tickets afterwards.  The good thing is that once you had your 10 tickets you could buy a ticket individually after that for $1/ticket.

4315,Full Moon Over Parliament Last Night,"Thank you.

That's been my absolute favourite view for years now, and reminds me of when I used to walk back to Ottawa over the Alexandra on a clear night, with the moon sitting low (far lower than in your photo), echoing the face of the Peace Tower. I'd often wish on those nights to have a camera handy to take a picture, but it was before camera phones were ubiquitous and I've ever been a reluctant techy (luddite, not technophobe). 

So I'm really happy to see a similar image to what I remember crop up here at last.",0.2,0.5499999999999999
